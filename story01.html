阎学通：中国行为的根源<br><br>
本文来源于《财经网》　 2011年03月31日<br><br>

60多年前，美国外交官乔治・凯南发表了一篇激起美国乃至世界舆论的文章《苏联行为的根源》。该文促成了冷战时期的美国强硬外交。如今，随着中国对全球经济的影响力日益增大及其军事投送能力不断增强，怎样理解中国行为的思想根源也就成为了国际关系中的核心问题之一。事实上，深入理解中国外交政策的思想根源有助于防止中美两国之间出现类似美苏那样的强硬对抗。<br><br>

自2008年以来，中国的学者以及战略研究者对本国外交政策性质的讨论就主要集中在两个方面：即中国外交政策的意识形态基础，以及中国的国际号召力和国际立场――也就是所谓的“软实力”。<br><br>

主流派被称为“中国学派”。该派与政府观点一致，都坚持将“有中国特色的马克思主义”作为中国外交政策的基本原则。而少数派则认为中国应以本国传统政治思想为基础，强调传统中国哲学中的普世价值。就在中国共产党党报《人民日报》不断发文抨击普世价值这一理念的情况下，党却为中国传统思想的核心人物孔子恢复了名誉，以致在天安门广场东侧竖起孔子的塑像。<br><br>

当中国学派坚持在国际事务中实行邓小平的韬光养晦原则时，传统主义学派却呼吁中国要承担较多国际责任。主流的中国学派坚持将中国定义为发展中国家，其理由是中国目前的人均GDP仍排在世界第104位；而传统主义者则认为中国已经是仅次于美国的世界第二大经济体，因此应当在国际事务中承担起相应的责任。<br><br>

目前，中国学派的影响力似乎主要体现在官方的声明层面，而传统主义者对政策行为的影响却似乎有上升趋势。例如，中国政府在利比亚危机中一如既往地重申了不干涉内政的外交原则，但却批准了联合国对卡扎菲政府的制裁决议。<br><br>

此外中国还派出了一艘军舰和4架军用飞机赴地中海协助35860名中国公民以及其他国家的2100人撤离利比亚。这一做法是中国政府第一次将中国海军部署到如此远的地方，这与儒家的理念是一致的，即将道义作为制定对外政策的首要标准，而不是像马克思主义理论那样将经济利益视为外交政策的唯一动力。<br><br>

早期的儒家思想家们著述时所面临的政治环境是诸多小国残酷地争夺领土。他们认为，国际实力的关键要素是政治实力，而政治实力的核心则是有道义的政治领导。他们认为，统治者应尽可能地依据道义规范行事。任何王者都从整个世界的角度考虑政策而不是一个国家。
<br><br>
因此，孔子思想的最大继承者孟子认为，王者应当惩罚那些在本国施行暴政的统治者。他认为，不顾道义而仰仗军事或经济实力维持统治的君主是不可能长期屹立于国际舞台之上的。<br><br>

虽然中国正在全世界范围内设立孔子学院，但中国传统政治哲学在决策中却并不具有决定性的作用。尽管我们无法判断是否是中国的传统思想对中国此次制定对利比亚的政策起了重大作用；但我们不能排除这些传统思想在可见的未来成为中国外交政策圈的主流思想。有一次，亨利・基辛格对笔者说，他认为中国的传统思想将比任何外来的意识形态（例如马克思主义或者自由主义）都更可能成为中国外交政策制定中的主导思想。<br><br>

内政经济是影响一国外交政策的重要因素。在最近闭幕的第十一届全国人民代表大会上，讨论中听到最多的词是“幸福”，而不是以往官方词汇中的最常用的“经济发展”。这个变化预示着中国外交政策在未来可能进行调整，因为“福”一词在中国传统政治思想中出现的频率要远高于马克思主义政治哲学。<br><br>

早期儒家思想家认为，统治者的核心任务是提高民众福祉，其本质是基于生活的道义。由于贫穷阻碍了实行道义，因此他们认为国家应致力于消除贫困。但是，孔子及其追随者是唾弃为求经济发展而罔顾道义的治国理念的。<br><br>

春节是中国人家庭团圆的重要节日。在2010年2月春节，中国国家总理温家宝发表讲话，他说，政府的工作是让人民生活得更加幸福和更有尊严。在2011年3月举行的一场记者招待会上，他说，没有政治体制改革经济改革不可能成功，当前面临的最大威胁是腐败。<br><br>

这些说法对于今天的中国人来说相当新鲜的，因为这些说法都是强调政治因素的重要性，而非党以往经常强调的经济决定论。<br><br>

中国传统政治思想注重道义责任，我们如今还难以判断这种传统政治思想将中国外交政策产生何种以及什么程度的影响，但我们确知传统理念对中国政治生活的影响力正在增强。在未来的几年里，没有任何力量都能在未来扭转这一趋势。<br><br>

阎学通：中国行为的根源<br><br>

Yan Xuetong is Dean of the Institute of Modern International Relations at Tsinghua University and the author of Ancient Chinese Thought, Modern Chinese Power, recently published by Princeton University Press.
<br><br>
作者是清华大学当代国际关系研究院院长，其著作Ancient Chinese Thought，Modern Chinese Power最近刚由美国普林斯顿大学出版社出版。<br><br>


BEIJING C Six decades ago, the American diplomat George Kennan wrote an article, “The Sources of Soviet Conduct,” that galvanized American and world opinion, which soon hardened into the rigid postures of the Cold War. Today, given China’s decisive influence on the global economy, and its increasing ability to project military power, understanding the sources of Chinese conduct has become a central issue in international relations. Indeed, better understanding of China’s foreign policy motivations may help prevent relations between China and the United States from hardening into rigid and antagonistic postures.<br><br>

Since 2008, discussions among Chinese scholars and strategists on the nature of their country’s foreign policy have focused on two issues: its ideological foundations, and China’s international appeal and standing C its “soft power.”
<br><br>
Mainstream thinking, known as the Chinese School, insists, with the government, on “Marxism with Chinese characteristics” as the bedrock principle of China’s foreign policy. But a minority school argues that China should rely instead on the country’s traditional political thought, emphasizing the universal value of traditional Chinese philosophy. While People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper, consistently attacks that position, the Party itself has been rehabilitating Confucius, the central figure in Chinese traditional thought, going so far as to erect a statue of him in Tiananmen Square.<br><br>

The Chinese School insists on adhering to Deng Xiaoping’s doctrine of maintaining a low profile in international diplomacy, while the traditionalist group advocates taking on greater international responsibility. The mainstream school defines China as a developing country, pointing to China’s per capita GDP, which ranks only 104th in the world. The traditionalists argue that China should assume responsibility for world affairs consistent with its status as the world’s second-largest economy, behind only the US.<br><br>

Today, the impact of the Chinese School seems to be limited mostly to official statements, while the traditionalists are gradually gaining policy influence. For example, the Chinese government reiterated its core diplomatic principle of non-intervention in other countries’ affairs during the Libya crisis, yet China accepted the imposition of United Nations’ sanctions on Muammar Qaddafi’s government.<br><br>

Moreover, China dispatched a warship and four military aircraft to the Mediterranean to help evacuate 35,860 Chinese nationals and 2,100 others from Libya. That measure, the first projection of Chinese naval power so far from home, is consistent with Confucianism, which regards morality as the top priority of policymaking, rather than Marxism, according to which economic interests alone drive foreign policy.<br><br>

Early Confucian thinkers were writing in a world of small countries competing ruthlessly for territorial advantage. For them, the key to international power was political power, and the central attribute of political power was a morally informed leadership. Rulers, they believed, should act in accord with moral norms whenever possible. And the sphere of concern for any humane ruler should be the whole world, not just the people of one state.<br><br>

Thus, thinkers such as Mencius, Confucius’s leading intellectual heir, argued that humane authorities should punish immoral rulers in other states who tyrannize their people. Rulers who rely mostly on military or economic might divorced from morality, he argued, cannot achieve long-term success on the international stage.<br><br>

Although China is building Confucius Institutes across the globe, China’s traditional political philosophy does not often play decisive role in policymaking. China’s policy toward Libya, which differs significantly from previous policy, may or may not have been shaped by it; nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility of it becoming the mainstream of thinking in Chinese foreign-policy circles in the near future. Indeed, Henry Kissinger once told me that he believes that Chinese traditional thought has a greater chance than any foreign ideology (say, Marxism or liberalism) of becoming the dominant intellectual force behind Chinese foreign policymaking.<br><br>

Domestic politics is always an important factor influencing a country’s foreign policy. At the recently concluded 11th People’s National Congress, the word heard most often in policy discussions was “happiness,” which had suddenly replaced “economic growth” as the official mantra. This change may augur future adjustments in China’s foreign policy as well, for “happiness” is a word used more frequently in Chinese traditional political thought than in Marxist political philosophy.
<br><br>
According to early Confucian thinkers, a key task for rulers is to strive to improve a peoples’ happiness, which is itself grounded in a moral way of life. Because poverty was an obstacle to moral behavior, they believed that the state should be vitally concerned with eliminating it. The idea that the state should pursue economic growth without consideration for moral concerns was anathema to Confucius and his followers.<br><br>

In February 2010, at “Spring Festival” C one of China’s biggest holidays, marked by family reunions C Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said that the government should help people live with dignity and happiness. At a press conference this month, he said that economic reform cannot succeed without political reform, and that corruption currently poses the gravest danger to China.<br><br>

Such statements sounded new to Chinese ears, because they accentuated politics rather than trumpeting the Party’s usual emphasis on economic determinism.<br><br>

Today, it is impossible to tell what impact and how much influence Chinese traditional political thought C the traditional concern with moral duty, happiness, and honor C will have on China’s foreign policy. But it is certain that the influence of traditional ideas in Chinese public life is growing. Indeed, no force seems able to reverse this trend in the coming years.<br><br>

<b><a name="T2">Kennan, "The Sources of Soviet Conduct"</a> </b><br>
<hr><br>


George Kennan, "The Sources of Soviet Conduct" (1947)<br><br>
 

The single document that best illustrated American anti-communism and general suspicion of Soviet aspirations, was George Kennan's famous Long Telegram of 1946. The Long Telegram was perhaps the most cited and most influential statement of the early years of the Cold War.<br><br>

George Kennan had been a American diplomat on the Soviet front, beginning his career as an observer of the aftermath of the Russian Civil War. He witnessed collectivization and the terror from close range and sent his telegram after another two years' service in Moscow from 1944 to 1946 as chief of mission and Ambassador Averell Harriman's consultant. In 1946, Kennan was 44 years old, fluent in the Russian language and its affairs, and decidedly anti-communist.
<br><br>
The essence of Kennan's telegram was published in Foreign Affairs in 1947 as The Sources of Soviet Conduct and circulated everywhere. The article was signed by "X" although everyone in the know knew that authorship was Kennan's. For Kennan, the Cold War gave the United States its historic opportunity to assume leadership of what would eventually be described as the "free world."<br><br>

1946年，凯南在美国驻苏联使馆工作期间，通过观察分析，认定与美国意识形态相对立的苏联，终将成为美国的威胁。由于时任驻苏大使哈里曼与他意见有出入，所以他趁大使回国自己任代办之机，亲自起草了一份8000字的电报，提出对苏联一定要实施"遏制"政策。在一贯讲求语言简洁的外交圈，这么长的电报通常是被扔进废纸篓的，但因该电报内容与华盛顿决策圈不谋而合，所以受到了不同寻常的重视。

1947年，已是美国国务院政策研究室主任的凯南化名X先生，在美国《外交》季刊上发表文章，正式提出对苏联实行"长期、耐心和坚定"的遏制政策，成为美国"遏制"政策的鼻祖。"遏制"一词也从此成为美国在针对与其意识形态相异的国家制定外交政策时的口头禅。美国不仅在苏联解体之前一直将其奉为对苏政策的圭臬，还将"遏制"的范围扩大到伊朗和中国等国。甚至1998年克林顿访华前夕，美国还爆发过一次关于对中国到底是要遏制还是要接触的大争论。<br><br>

Kennan was born in Mobile, Wisconsin, to Kossuth Kent Kennan, a lawyer specializing in tax law, and Florence James Kennan. Mrs. Kennan died two months later due to peritonitis from a ruptured appendix, though Kennan long believed that she died after giving birth to him.[3] The boy always lamented not having a mother; he was never close to his father or stepmother. However, he was close to his older sisters. He attended St. John's Military Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin, and arrived at Princeton University in the second half of 1921.[4] Unaccustomed to the "elite" atmosphere of the Ivy League, the shy and introverted Kennan found his undergraduate years difficult and lonely.[5] After receiving his bachelor's degree in 1925, Kennan considered applying to law school, but decided it was too expensive and instead opted to apply to the newly formed Foreign Service.[6][7] He passed the qualifying examination and after seven months of studying at the Foreign Service School in Washington he took on his first post as a vice consul in Geneva Switzerland. Within a year he was transferred to a post in Hamburg Germany. In 1928 Kennan considered leaving the Foreign Service to go back to school when he was selected for a linguist training program that would give him three years of graduate-level study without having to leave the service.[6]<br><br>

In 1929 Kennan began his program on history, politics, culture, and the Russian language at the University of Berlin's Oriental Institute. In doing so, he would follow in the footsteps of his grandfather's younger cousin, George Kennan (explorer), who had been a leading 19th-century expert on Imperial Russia and author of Siberia and the Exile System, a well-received 1891 account of the Czarist prison system.[8] During the course of his diplomatic career, Kennan would master a number of other languages, including German, French, Polish, Czech, Portuguese, and Norwegian.[7]<br><br>

In 1931 Kennan was stationed at the legation in Riga, Latvia, where, as third secretary, he worked on Soviet economic affairs. From his post, Kennan "grew to mature interest in Russian affairs".[9] When the U.S. opened diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union in 1933 following the election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Kennan accompanied U.S. ambassador William C. Bullitt to Moscow. By the mid-1930s, Kennan was among the core of professionally trained Russian experts on the staff of the U.S. embassy in Moscow, along with Charles E. Bohlen and Loy W. Henderson. These officials had been influenced by the long-time head of the State Department's division of East European Affairs, Robert F. Kelley.[10] They believed that there was little basis for cooperation with the Soviet Union, even against potential adversaries.[11] Meanwhile, Kennan closely followed Stalin's Great Purge, which would profoundly affect his outlook on the internal dynamics of the Soviet regime for the rest of his life.[9]<br><br>

Kennan found himself in strong disagreement with Joseph E. Davies, Bullitt's successor as ambassador to the Soviet Union, who was indifferent[citation needed] to the Great Purge and other aspects of Stalin's rule. Kennan carried no sway over Davies's decisions, and the ambassador even suggested that Kennan be transferred out of Moscow for "his health".[9][citation needed] Kennan again contemplated resigning from the service, but instead decided to accept the Russian desk at State Department in Washington.[12] By September 1938, Kennan had been reassigned to a post at the legation in Prague. Following the fall of the Czechoslovak Republic to Nazi Germany at the outbreak of World War II, Kennan was assigned to Berlin. There, he supported the United States' Lend-Lease policy, but warned against displaying any notion of American support for the Soviet Union, which he considered to be an unfit ally. He was interned in Germany for six months after the United States had entered the war in December 1941.[13]<br><br>

In September 1942, Kennan was assigned as a counselor in Lisbon, where he begrudgingly took on an administrative role handling intelligence and base operations. In January 1944, he was sent to London, where he served as counselor of the U.S. delegation to the European Advisory Commission, which worked to prepare Allied policy in Europe. There, Kennan grew even more disenchanted with the State Department, which he believed was ignoring his qualifications as a trained specialist. However, within months of entering the post, he was appointed deputy chief of the U.S. mission in Moscow, upon request by W. Averell Harriman, the ambassador to the Soviet Union.[14]<br><br>

Cold War <br><br>

The "long telegram"<br><br>

In Moscow, Kennan again felt that his opinions were being ignored by Harry S. Truman and policymakers in Washington. Kennan tried repeatedly to persuade policymakers to abandon plans for cooperation with the Soviet Union in favor of a sphere of influence approach in Europe to reduce the Soviets' power there. Kennan believed that a federation needed to be established in western Europe to counter Soviet influence and power in the region and to compete against the Soviet stronghold in eastern Europe.[15]<br><br>

Kennan served as deputy head of the U.S. mission in Moscow until April 1946. Near the end of that term, the Treasury Department requested that the State Department explain recent Soviet behavior, such as its disinclination to support the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.[7] Kennan responded on February 22, 1946, by sending a lengthy 5,500-word telegram (sometimes cited as being over 8,000 words) from Moscow to Secretary of State James Byrnes outlining a new strategy on how to handle diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.[1] At the "bottom of the Kremlin's neurotic view of world affairs is the traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity". Following the Russian Revolution, this sense of insecurity became mixed with communist ideology and "Oriental secretiveness and conspiracy".[16]<br><br>

Soviet behavior on the international stage depended chiefly on the internal necessities of Joseph Stalin's regime; according to Kennan, Stalin needed a hostile world in order to legitimize his autocratic rule. Stalin thus used Marxism-Leninism as a "justification for the Soviet Union's instinctive fear of the outside world, for the dictatorship without which they did not know how to rule, for cruelties they did not dare not to inflict, for sacrifice they felt bound to demand...Today they cannot dispense with it. It is the fig leaf of their moral and intellectual respectability".[16]
<br><br>
The solution was to strengthen Western institutions in order to render them invulnerable to the Soviet challenge, while awaiting the mellowing of the Soviet regime.[17]<br><br>

Kennan's new policy of containment was that Soviet pressure had to "be contained by the adroit and vigilant application of counterforce at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points".[18]<br><br>

This dispatch brought Kennan to the attention of Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, a leading advocate among Truman's inner circle of a hard-line approach to relations with the Soviets, the United States' former wartime ally. Forrestal helped bring Kennan back to Washington, where he served as the first deputy for foreign affairs at the National War College and then strongly influenced his decision to publish the "X" article.[7][19]
<br><br>
The goal of his policy was to withdraw all the U.S. forces from Europe. The settlement reached would give the Kremlin sufficient reassurance against the establishment of regimes in Eastern Europe hostile to the Soviet Union, tempering the degree of control over that area that the Soviet leaders felt it necessary to exercise.[20]<br><br>

Meanwhile, in March 1947, Truman appeared before Congress and used Kennan's warnings in the "long telegram" as the basis of what became known as the Truman Doctrine. "I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures."[21]<br><br>

"X"<br><br>

 Kennan in 1947<br><br>
Main article: X Article<br><br>

Unlike the "long telegram", Kennan's well-timed article appearing in the July 1947 issue of Foreign Affairs under the pseudonym "X", entitled "The Sources of Soviet Conduct", did not begin by emphasizing "traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity";[16] instead it asserted that Stalin's policy was shaped by a combination of MarxistCLeninist ideology, which advocated revolution to defeat the capitalist forces in the outside world and Stalin's determination to use the notion of "capitalist encirclement" as a fig leaf legitimizing his regimentation of Soviet society so that he could consolidate his political power.[22] Kennan argued that Stalin would not (and moreover could not) moderate the supposed Soviet determination to overthrow Western governments. Thus,<br><br>


"the main element of any United States policy toward the Soviet Union must be a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies.... Soviet pressure against the free institutions of the Western world is something that can be contained by the adroit and vigilant application of counterforce at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points, corresponding to the shifts and manoeuvers of Soviet policy, but which cannot be charmed or talked out of existence."[23]<br><br>

His new policy of containment declared that Soviet pressure had to "be contained by the adroit and vigilant application of counter-force at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points".[18] The goal of his policy was to withdraw all the U.S. forces from Europe. "The settlement reached would give the Kremlin sufficient reassurance against the establishment of regimes in Eastern Europe hostile to the Soviet Union, tempering the degree of control over that area that the Soviet leaders felt it necessary to exercise".[20]<br><br>

Kennan further argued that the United States would have to undertake this containment alone but if it could do so without undermining its own economic health and political stability, the Soviet party structure would undergo a period of immense strain eventually resulting in "either the break-up or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power".[24]<br><br>

The publication of the "X" article soon triggered one of the more intense debates of the Cold War. Walter Lippmann, a leading U.S. journalist and commentator on international affairs, strongly criticized the "X" article.[25] Lippmann argued that Kennan's strategy of containment was "a strategic monstrosity" that could "be implemented only by recruiting, subsidizing and supporting a heterogeneous array of satellites, clients, dependents, and puppets".[26] Lippmann argued that diplomacy was the key towards improving relations with the Soviets; he suggested that the U.S. withdraw its forces from Europe and reunify and demilitarize Germany.[27] Meanwhile, word soon leaked out that "X" was indeed Kennan. This information gave the "X" article the status of an official document expressing the Truman administration's new policy toward Moscow.[28]<br><br>

Kennan had not intended the "X" article as a prescription for policy.[29] For the rest of his life, Kennan continued to reiterate that the article did not imply an automatic commitment to resist Soviet "expansionism" wherever it occurred, with little distinction of primary and secondary interests. The article did not make it clear that Kennan favored employing political and economic rather than military methods as the chief agent of containment.[30] "My thoughts about containment" said Kennan in a 1996 interview to CNN, "were of course distorted by the people who understood it and pursued it exclusively as a military concept; and I think that that, as much as any other cause, led to [the] 40 years of unnecessary, fearfully expensive and disoriented process of the Cold War".[31]<br><br>

In addition, the administration made few attempts to explain the distinction between Soviet influence and the international Communist movement to the U.S. public. "In part, this failure reflected the belief of many in Washington", writes historian John Lewis Gaddis, "that only the prospect of an undifferentiated global threat could shake Americans out of their isolationist tendencies that remained latent among them".[32]<br><br>

In a PBS television interview with David Gergen in 1996, Kennan again reiterated that he did not regard the Soviets as primarily a military threat, noting that "they were not like Hitler". In Kennan's view, this misunderstanding:<br><br>


"all came down to one sentence in the "X" article where I said that wherever these people, meaning the Soviet leadership, confronted us with dangerous hostility anywhere in the world, we should do everything possible to contain it and not let them expand any further. I should have explained that I didn't suspect them of any desire to launch an attack on us. This was right after the war, and it was absurd to suppose that they were going to turn around and attack the United States. I didn't think I needed to explain that, but I obviously should have done it."[33]<br><br>

The "X" article meant sudden fame for Kennan, who became the father of the government's containment doctrine overnight, leading him to write in his memoirs, "My official loneliness came in fact to an end...My reputation was made. My voice now carried."<br><br>

THE SOURCES OF SOVIET CONDUCT<br><br>

By X<br><br>

Part I<br><br>

The political personality of Soviet power as we know it today is the product of ideology and circumstances: ideology inherited by the present Soviet leaders from the movement in which they had their political origin, and circumstances of the power which they now have exercised for nearly three decades in Russia. There can be few tasks of psychological analysis more difficult than to try to trace the interaction of these two forces and the relative role of each in the determination of official Soviet conduct. yet the attempt must be made if that conduct is to be understood and effectively countered.<br><br>

It is difficult to summarize the set of ideological concepts with which the Soviet leaders came into power. Marxian ideology, in its Russian-Communist projection, has always been in process of subtle evolution. The materials on which it bases itself are extensive and complex. But the outstanding features of Communist thought as it existed in 1916 may perhaps be summarized as follows: (a) that the central factor in the life of man, the factor which determines the character of public life and the "physiognomy of society," is the system by which material goods are produced and exchanged; (b) that the capitalist system of production is a nefarious one which inevitable leads to the exploitation of the working class by the capital-owning class and is incapable of developing adequately the economic resources of society or of distributing fairly the material good produced by human labor; (c) that capitalism contains the seeds of its own destruction and must, in view of the inability of the capital-owning class to adjust itself to economic change, result eventually and inescapably in a revolutionary transfer of power to the working class; and (d) that imperialism, the final phase of capitalism, leads directly to war and revolution.<br><br>

The rest may be outlined in Lenin's own words: "Unevenness of economic and political development is the inflexible law of capitalism. It follows from this that the victory of Socialism may come originally in a few capitalist countries or even in a single capitalist country. The victorious proletariat of that country, having expropriated the capitalists and having organized Socialist production at home, would rise against the remaining capitalist world, drawing to itself in the process the oppressed classes of other countries." It must be noted that there was no assumption that capitalism would perish without proletarian revolution. A final push was needed from a revolutionary proletariat movement in order to tip over the tottering structure. But it was regarded as inevitable that sooner of later that push be given.<br><br>

For 50 years prior to the outbreak of the Revolution, this pattern of thought had exercised great fascination for the members of the Russian revolutionary movement. Frustrated, discontented, hopeless of finding self-expression -- or too impatient to seek it -- in the confining limits of the Tsarist political system, yet lacking wide popular support or their choice of bloody revolution as a means of social betterment, these revolutionists found in Marxist theory a highly convenient rationalization for their own instinctive desires. It afforded pseudo-scientific justification for their impatience, for their categoric denial of all value in the Tsarist system, for their yearning for power and revenge and for their inclination to cut corners in the pursuit of it. It is therefore no wonder that they had come to believe implicitly in the truth and soundness of the Marxist-Leninist teachings, so congenial to their own impulses and emotions. Their sincerity need not be impugned. This is a phenomenon as old as human nature itself. It is has never been more aptly described than by Edward Gibbon, who wrote in The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: "From enthusiasm to imposture the step is perilous and slippery; the demon of Socrates affords a memorable instance of how a wise man may deceive himself, how a good man may deceive others, how the conscience may slumber in a mixed and middle state between self-illusion and voluntary fraud." And it was with this set of conceptions that the members of the Bolshevik Party entered into power.
<br><br>
Now it must be noted that through all the years of preparation for revolution, the attention of these men, as indeed of Marx himself, had been centered less on the future form which Socialism would take than on the necessary overthrow of rival power which, in their view, had to precede the introduction of Socialism. Their views, therefore, on the positive program to be put into effect, once power was attained, were for the most part nebulous, visionary and impractical. beyond the nationalization of industry and the expropriation of large private capital holdings there was no agreed program. The treatment of the peasantry, which, according to the Marxist formulation was not of the proletariat, had always been a vague spot in the pattern of Communist thought: and it remained an object of controversy and vacillation for the first ten years of Communist power.<br><br>

The circumstances of the immediate post-revolution period -- the existence in Russia of civil war and foreign intervention, together with the obvious fact that the Communists represented only a tiny minority of the Russian people -- made the establishment of dictatorial power a necessity. The experiment with war Communism" and the abrupt attempt to eliminate private production and trade had unfortunate economic consequences and caused further bitterness against the new revolutionary regime. While the temporary relaxation of the effort to communize Russia, represented by the New Economic Policy, alleviated some of this economic distress and thereby served its purpose, it also made it evident that the "capitalistic sector of society" was still prepared to profit at once from any relaxation of governmental pressure, and would, if permitted to continue to exist, always constitute a powerful opposing element to the Soviet regime and a serious rival for influence in the country. Somewhat the same situation prevailed with respect to the individual peasant who, in his own small way, was also a private producer.<br><br>

Lenin, had he lived, might have proved a great enough man to reconcile these conflicting forces to the ultimate benefit of Russian society, thought this is questionable. But be that as it may, Stalin, and those whom he led in the struggle for succession to Lenin's position of leadership, were not the men to tolerate rival political forces in the sphere of power which they coveted. Their sense of insecurity was too great. Their particular brand of fanaticism, unmodified by any of the Anglo-Saxon traditions of compromise, was too fierce and too jealous to envisage any permanent sharing of power. From the Russian-Asiatic world out of which they had emerged they carried with them a skepticism as to the possibilities of permanent and peaceful coexistence of rival forces. Easily persuaded of their own doctrinaire "rightness," they insisted on the submission or destruction of all competing power. Outside the Communist Party, Russian society was to have no rigidity. There were to be no forms of collective human activity or association which would not be dominated by the Party. No other force in Russian society was to be permitted to achieve vitality or integrity. Only the Party was to have structure. All else was to be an amorphous mass.<br><br>

And within the Party the same principle was to apply. The mass of Party members might go through the motions of election, deliberation, decision and action; but in these motions they were to be animated not by their own individual wills but by the awesome breath of the Party leadership and the overbrooding presence of "the word."<br><br>

Let it be stressed again that subjectively these men probably did not seek absolutism for its own sake. They doubtless believed -- and found it easy to believe -- that they alone knew what was good for society and that they would accomplish that good once their power was secure and unchallengeable. But in seeking that security of their own rule they were prepared to recognize no restrictions, either of God or man, on the character of their methods. And until such time as that security might be achieved, they placed far down on their scale of operational priorities the comforts and happiness of the peoples entrusted to their care.<br><br>

Now the outstanding circumstance concerning the Soviet regime is that down to the present day this process of political consolidation has never been completed and the men in the Kremlin have continued to be predominantly absorbed with the struggle to secure and make absolute the power which they seized in November 1917. They have endeavored to secure it primarily against forces at home, within Soviet society itself. But they have also endeavored to secure it against the outside world. For ideology, as we have seen, taught them that the outside world was hostile and that it was their duty eventually to overthrow the political forces beyond their borders. Then powerful hands of Russian history and tradition reached up to sustain them in this feeling. Finally, their own aggressive intransigence with respect to the outside world began to find its own reaction; and they were soon forced, to use another Gibbonesque phrase, "to chastise the contumacy" which they themselves had provoked. It is an undeniable privilege of every man to prove himself right in the thesis that the world is his enemy; for if he reiterates it frequently enough and makes it the background of his conduct he is bound eventually to be right.<br><br>

Now it lies in the nature of the mental world of the Soviet leaders, as well as in the character of their ideology, that no opposition to them can be officially recognized as having any merit or justification whatsoever. Such opposition can flow, in theory, only from the hostile and incorrigible forces of dying capitalism. As long as remnants of capitalism were officially recognized as existing in Russia, it was possible to place on them, as an internal element, part of the blame for the maintenance of a dictatorial form of society. But as these remnants were liquidated, little by little, this justification fell away, and when it was indicated officially that they had been finally destroyed, it disappeared altogether. And this fact created one of the most basic of the compulsions which came to act upon the Soviet regime: since capitalism no longer existed in Russia and since it could not be admitted that there could be serious or widespread opposition to the Kremlin springing spontaneously from the liberated masses under its authority, it became necessary to justify the retention of the dictatorship by stressing the menace of capitalism abroad.<br><br>

This began at an early date. In 1924 Stalin specifically defended the retention of the "organs of suppression," meaning, among others, the army and the secret police, on the ground that "as long as there is a capitalistic encirclement there will be danger of intervention with all the consequences that flow from that danger." In accordance with that theory, and from that time on, all internal opposition forces in Russia have consistently been portrayed as the agents of foreign forces of reaction antagonistic to Soviet power.<br><br>

By the same token, tremendous emphasis has been placed on the original Communist thesis of a basic antagonism between the capitalist and Socialist worlds. It is clear, from many indications, that this emphasis is not founded in reality. The real facts concerning it have been confused by the existence abroad of genuine resentment provoked by Soviet philosophy and tactics and occasionally by the existence of great centers of military power, notably the Nazi regime in Germany and the Japanese Government of the late 1930s, which indeed have aggressive designs against the Soviet Union. But there is ample evidence that the stress laid in Moscow on the menace confronting Soviet society from the world outside its borders is founded not in the realities of foreign antagonism but in the necessity of explaining away the maintenance of dictatorial authority at home.<br><br>

Now the maintenance of this pattern of Soviet power, namely, the pursuit of unlimited authority domestically, accompanied by the cultivation of the semi-myth of implacable foreign hostility, has gone far to shape the actual machinery of Soviet power as we know it today. Internal organs of administration which did not serve this purpose withered on the vine. Organs which did serve this purpose became vastly swollen. The security of Soviet power came to rest on the iron discipline of the Party, on the severity and ubiquity of the secret police, and on the uncompromising economic monopolism of the state. The "organs of suppression," in which the Soviet leaders had sought security from rival forces, became in large measures the masters of those whom they were designed to serve. Today the major part of the structure of Soviet power is committed to the perfection of the dictatorship and to the maintenance of the concept of Russia as in a state of siege, with the enemy lowering beyond the walls. And the millions of human beings who form that part of the structure of power must defend at all costs this concept of Russia's position, for without it they are themselves superfluous.<br><br>

As things stand today, the rulers can no longer dream of parting with these organs of suppression. The quest for absolute power, pursued now for nearly three decades with a ruthlessness unparalleled (in scope at least) in modern times, has again produced internally, as it did externally, its own reaction. The excesses of the police apparatus have fanned the potential opposition to the regime into something far greater and more dangerous than it could have been before those excesses began.<br><br>

But least of all can the rulers dispense with the fiction by which the maintenance of dictatorial power has been defended. For this fiction has been canonized in Soviet philosophy by the excesses already committed in its name; and it is now anchored in the Soviet structure of thought by bonds far greater than those of mere ideology.<br><br>

Part II<br><br>

So much for the historical background. What does it spell in terms of the political personality of Soviet power as we know it today?<br><br>

Of the original ideology, nothing has been officially junked. Belief is maintained in the basic badness of capitalism, in the inevitability of its destruction, in the obligation of the proletariat to assist in that destruction and to take power into its own hands. But stress has come to be laid primarily on those concepts which relate most specifically to the Soviet regime itself: to its position as the sole truly Socialist regime in a dark and misguided world, and to the relationships of power within it.<br><br>

The first of these concepts is that of the innate antagonism between capitalism and Socialism. We have seen how deeply that concept has become imbedded in foundations of Soviet power. It has profound implications for Russia's conduct as a member of international society. It means that there can never be on Moscow's side an sincere assumption of a community of aims between the Soviet Union and powers which are regarded as capitalist. It must inevitably be assumed in Moscow that the aims of the capitalist world are antagonistic to the Soviet regime, and therefore to the interests of the peoples it controls. If the Soviet government occasionally sets it signature to documents which would indicate the contrary, this is to regarded as a tactical maneuver permissible in dealing with the enemy (who is without honor) and should be taken in the spirit of caveat emptor. Basically, the antagonism remains. It is postulated. And from it flow many of the phenomena which we find disturbing in the Kremlin's conduct of foreign policy: the secretiveness, the lack of frankness, the duplicity, the wary suspiciousness, and the basic unfriendliness of purpose. These phenomena are there to stay, for the foreseeable future. There can be variations of degree and of emphasis. When there is something the Russians want from us, one or the other of these features of their policy may be thrust temporarily into the background; and when that happens there will always be Americans who will leap forward with gleeful announcements that "the Russians have changed," and some who will even try to take credit for having brought about such "changes." But we should not be misled by tactical maneuvers. These characteristics of Soviet policy, like the postulate from which they flow, are basic to the internal nature of Soviet power, and will be with us, whether in the foreground or the background, until the internal nature of Soviet power is changed.<br><br>

This means we are going to continue for long time to find the Russians difficult to deal with. It does not mean that they should be considered as embarked upon a do-or-die program to overthrow our society by a given date. The theory of the inevitability of the eventual fall of capitalism has the fortunate connotation that there is no hurry about it. The forces of progress can take their time in preparing the final coup de gr锟ce. meanwhile, what is vital is that the "Socialist fatherland" -- that oasis of power which has already been won for Socialism in the person of the Soviet Union -- should be cherished and defended by all good Communists at home and abroad, its fortunes promoted, its enemies badgered and confounded. The promotion of premature, "adventuristic" revolutionary projects abroad which might embarrass Soviet power in any way would be an inexcusable, even a counter-revolutionary act. The cause of Socialism is the support and promotion of Soviet power, as defined in Moscow.<br><br>

This brings us to the second of the concepts important to contemporary Soviet outlook. That is the infallibility of the Kremlin. The Soviet concept of power, which permits no focal points of organization outside the Party itself, requires that the Party leadership remain in theory the sole repository of truth. For if truth were to be found elsewhere, there would be justification for its expression in organized activity. But it is precisely that which the Kremlin cannot and will not permit.<br><br>

The leadership of the Communist Party is therefore always right, and has been always right ever since in 1929 Stalin formalized his personal power by announcing that decisions of the Politburo were being taken unanimously.
<br><br>
On the principle of infallibility there rests the iron discipline of the Communist Party. In fact, the two concepts are mutually self-supporting. Perfect discipline requires recognition of infallibility. Infallibility requires the observance of discipline. And the two go far to determine the behaviorism of the entire Soviet apparatus of power. But their effect cannot be understood unless a third factor be taken into account: namely, the fact that the leadership is at liberty to put forward for tactical purposes any particular thesis which it finds useful to the cause at any particular moment and to require the faithful and unquestioning acceptance of that thesis by the members of the movement as a whole. This means that truth is not a constant but is actually created, for all intents and purposes, by the Soviet leaders themselves. It may vary from week to week, from month to month. It is nothing absolute and immutable -- nothing which flows from objective reality. It is only the most recent manifestation of the wisdom of those in whom the ultimate wisdom is supposed to reside, because they represent the logic of history. The accumulative effect of these factors is to give to the whole subordinate apparatus of Soviet power an unshakable stubbornness and steadfastness in its orientation. This orientation can be changed at will by the Kremlin but by no other power. Once a given party line has been laid down on a given issue of current policy, the whole Soviet governmental machine, including the mechanism of diplomacy, moves inexorably along the prescribed path, like a persistent toy automobile wound up and headed in a given direction, stopping only when it meets with some unanswerable force. The individuals who are the components of this machine are unamenable to argument or reason, which comes to them from outside sources. Their whole training has taught them to mistrust and discount the glib persuasiveness of the outside world. Like the white dog before the phonograph, they hear only the "master's voice." And if they are to be called off from the purposes last dictated to them, it is the master who must call them off. Thus the foreign representative cannot hope that his words will make any impression on them. The most that he can hope is that they will be transmitted to those at the top, who are capable of changing the party line. But even those are not likely to be swayed by any normal logic in the words of the bourgeois representative. Since there can be no appeal to common purposes, there can be no appeal to common mental approaches. For this reason, facts speak louder than words to the ears of the Kremlin; and words carry the greatest weight when they have the ring of reflecting, or being backed up by, facts of unchallengeable validity.<br><br>

But we have seen that the Kremlin is under no ideological compulsion to accomplish its purposes in a hurry. Like the Church, it is dealing in ideological concepts which are of long-term validity, and it can afford to be patient. It has no right to risk the existing achievements of the revolution for the sake of vain baubles of the future. The very teachings of Lenin himself require great caution and flexibility in the pursuit of Communist purposes. Again, these precepts are fortified by the lessons of Russian history: of centuries of obscure battles between nomadic forces over the stretches of a vast unfortified plain. Here caution, circumspection, flexibility and deception are the valuable qualities; and their value finds a natural appreciation in the Russian or the oriental mind. Thus the Kremlin has no compunction about retreating in the face of superior forces. And being under the compulsion of no timetable, it does not get panicky under the necessity for such retreat. Its political action is a fluid stream which moves constantly, wherever it is permitted to move, toward a given goal. Its main concern is to make sure that it has filled every nook and cranny available to it in the basin of world power. But if it finds unassailable barriers in its path, it accepts these philosophically and accommodates itself to them. The main thing is that there should always be pressure, unceasing constant pressure, toward the desired goal. There is no trace of any feeling in Soviet psychology that that goal must be reached at any given time.
<br><br>
These considerations make Soviet diplomacy at once easier and more difficult to deal with than the diplomacy of individual aggressive leaders like Napoleon and Hitler. On the one hand it is more sensitive to contrary force, more ready to yield on individual sectors of the diplomatic front when that force is felt to be too strong, and thus more rational in the logic and rhetoric of power. On the other hand it cannot be easily defeated or discouraged by a single victory on the part of its opponents. And the patient persistence by which it is animated means that it can be effectively countered not by sporadic acts which represent the momentary whims of democratic opinion but only be intelligent long-range policies on the part of Russia's adversaries -- policies no less steady in their purpose, and no less variegated and resourceful in their application, than those of the Soviet Union itself.<br><br>

In these circumstances it is clear that the main element of any United States policy toward the Soviet Union must be that of long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies. It is important to note, however, that such a policy has nothing to do with outward histrionics: with threats or blustering or superfluous gestures of outward "toughness." While the Kremlin is basically flexible in its reaction to political realities, it is by no means unamenable to considerations of prestige. Like almost any other government, it can be placed by tactless and threatening gestures in a position where it cannot afford to yield even though this might be dictated by its sense of realism. The Russian leaders are keen judges of human psychology, and as such they are highly conscious that loss of temper and of self-control is never a source of strength in political affairs. They are quick to exploit such evidences of weakness. For these reasons it is a sine qua non of successful dealing with Russia that the foreign government in question should remain at all times cool and collected and that its demands on Russian policy should be put forward in such a manner as to leave the way open for a compliance not too detrimental to Russian prestige.

<hr><br>

Part III<br><br>

In the light of the above, it will be clearly seen that the Soviet pressure against the free institutions of the western world is something that can be contained by the adroit and vigilant application of counter-force at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points, corresponding to the shifts and maneuvers of Soviet policy, but which cannot be charmed or talked out of existence. The Russians look forward to a duel of infinite duration, and they see that already they have scored great successes. It must be borne in mind that there was a time when the Communist Party represented far more of a minority in the sphere of Russian national life than Soviet power today represents in the world community.
<br><br>
But if the ideology convinces the rulers of Russia that truth is on their side and they they can therefore afford to wait, those of us on whom that ideology has no claim are free to examine objectively the validity of that premise. The Soviet thesis not only implies complete lack of control by the west over its own economic destiny, it likewise assumes Russian unity, discipline and patience over an infinite period. Let us bring this apocalyptic vision down to earth, and suppose that the western world finds the strength and resourcefulness to contain Soviet power over a period of ten to fifteen years. What does that spell for Russia itself?<br><br>

The Soviet leaders, taking advantage of the contributions of modern techniques to the arts of despotism, have solved the question of obedience within the confines of their power. Few challenge their authority; and even those who do are unable to make that challenge valid as against the organs of suppression of the state.
<br><br>
The Kremlin has also proved able to accomplish its purpose of building up Russia, regardless of the interests of the inhabitants, and industrial foundation of heavy metallurgy, which is, to be sure, not yet complete but which is nevertheless continuing to grow and is approaching those of the other major industrial countries. All of this, however, both the maintenance of internal political security and the building of heavy industry, has been carried out at a terrible cost in human life and in human hopes and energies. It has necessitated the use of forced labor on a scale unprecedented in modern times under conditions of peace. It has involved the neglect or abuse of other phases of Soviet economic life, particularly agriculture, consumers' goods production, housing and transportation.
<br><br>
To all that, the war has added its tremendous toll of destruction, death and human exhaustion. In consequence of this, we have in Russia today a population which is physically and spiritually tired. The mass of the people are disillusioned, skeptical and no longer as accessible as they once were to the magical attraction which Soviet power still radiates to its followers abroad. The avidity with which people seized upon the slight respite accorded to the Church for tactical reasons during the war was eloquent testimony to the fact that their capacity for faith and devotion found little expression in the purposes of the regime.
<br><br>
In these circumstances, there are limits to the physical and nervous strength of people themselves. These limits are absolute ones, and are binding even for the cruelest dictatorship, because beyond them people cannot be driven. The forced labor camps and the other agencies of constraint provide temporary means of compelling people to work longer hours than their own volition or mere economic pressure would dictate; but if people survive them at all they become old before their time and must be considered as human casualties to the demands of dictatorship. In either case their best powers are no longer available to society and can no longer be enlisted in the service of the state.
<br><br>

<a href= "pic01.html">美国军费开支（预算） </a><br><br>
<a href= "pic02.html">美国控制域名解析系统</a><br><br>


Here only the younger generations can help. The younger generation, despite all vicissitudes and sufferings, is numerous and vigorous; and the Russians are a talented people. But it still remains to be seen what will be the effects on mature performance of the abnormal emotional strains of childhood which Soviet dictatorship created and which were enormously increased by the war. Such things as normal security and placidity of home environment have practically ceased to exist in the Soviet Union outside of the most remote farms and villages. And observers are not yet sure whether that is not going to leave its mark on the over-all capacity of the generation now coming into maturity.
<br><br>
In addition to this, we have the fact that Soviet economic development, while it can list certain formidable achievements, has been precariously spotty and uneven. Russian Communists who speak of the "uneven development of capitalism" should blush at the contemplation of their own national economy. Here certain branches of economic life, such as the metallurgical and machine industries, have been pushed out of all proportion to other sectors of economy. Here is a nation striving to become in a short period one of the great industrial nations of the world while it still has no highway network worthy of the name and only a relatively primitive network of railways. Much has been done to increase efficiency of labor and to teach primitive peasants something about the operation of machines. But maintenance is still a crying deficiency of all Soviet economy. Construction is hasty and poor in quality. Depreciation must be enormous. And in vast sectors of economic life it has not yet been possible to instill into labor anything like that general culture of production and technical self-respect which characterizes the skilled worker of the west.
<br><br>
It is difficult to see how these deficiencies can be corrected at an early date by a tired and dispirited population working largely under the shadow of fear and compulsion. And as long as they are not overcome, Russia will remain economically as vulnerable, and in a certain sense an impotent, nation, capable of exporting its enthusiasms and of radiating the strange charm of its primitive political vitality but unable to back up those articles of export by the real evidences of material power and prosperity.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, a great uncertainty hangs over the political life of the Soviet Union. That is the uncertainty involved in the transfer of power from one individual or group of individuals to others.
<br><br>
This is, of course, outstandingly the problem of the personal position of Stalin. We must remember that his succession to Lenin's pinnacle of pre-eminence in the Communist movement was the only such transfer of individual authority which the Soviet Union has experienced. That transfer took 12 years to consolidate. It cost the lives of millions of people and shook the state to its foundations. The attendant tremors were felt all through the international revolutionary movement, to the disadvantage of the Kremlin itself.
<br><br>
It is always possible that another transfer of pre-eminent power may take place quietly and inconspicuously, with no repercussions anywhere. But again, it is possible that the questions involved may unleash, to use some of Lenin's words, one of those "incredibly swift transitions" from "delicate deceit" to "wild violence" which characterize Russian history, and may shake Soviet power to its foundations.
<br><br>
<a href= "pic05.html">Company politics & decision-making</a><br><br>

But this is not only a question of Stalin himself. There has been, since 1938, a dangerous congealment of political life in the higher circles of Soviet power. The All-Union Congress of Soviets, in theory the supreme body of the Party, is supposed to meet not less often than once in three years. It will soon be eight full years since its last meeting. During this period membership in the Party has numerically doubled. Party mortality during the war was enormous; and today well over half of the Party members are persons who have entered since the last Party congress was held. meanwhile, the same small group of men has carried on at the top through an amazing series of national vicissitudes. Surely there is some reason why the experiences of the war brought basic political changes to every one of the great governments of the west. Surely the causes of that phenomenon are basic enough to be present somewhere in the obscurity of Soviet political life, as well. And yet no recognition has been given to these causes in Russia.
<br><br>
It must be surmised from this that even within so highly disciplined an organization as the Communist Party there must be a growing divergence in age, outlook and interest between the great mass of Party members, only so recently recruited into the movement, and the little self-perpetuating clique of men at the top, whom most of these Party members have never met, with whom they have never conversed, and with whom they can have no political intimacy.
<br><br>
Who can say whether, in these circumstances, the eventual rejuvenation of the higher spheres of authority (which can only be a matter of time) can take place smoothly and peacefully, or whether rivals in the quest for higher power will not eventually reach down into these politically immature and inexperienced masses in order to find support for their respective claims? If this were ever to happen, strange consequences could flow for the Communist Party: for the membership at large has been exercised only in the practices of iron discipline and obedience and not in the arts of compromise and accommodation. And if disunity were ever to seize and paralyze the Party, the chaos and weakness of Russian society would be revealed in forms beyond description. For we have seen that Soviet power is only concealing an amorphous mass of human beings among whom no independent organizational structure is tolerated. In Russia there is not even such a thing as local government. The present generation of Russians have never known spontaneity of collective action. If, consequently, anything were ever to occur to disrupt the unity and efficacy of the Party as a political instrument, Soviet Russia might be changed overnight from one of the strongest to one of the weakest and most pitiable of national societies.
<br><br>
Thus the future of Soviet power may not be by any means as secure as Russian capacity for self-delusion would make it appear to the men of the Kremlin. That they can quietly and easily turn it over to others remains to be proved. Meanwhile, the hardships of their rule and the vicissitudes of international life have taken a heavy toll of the strength and hopes of the great people on whom their power rests. It is curious to note that the ideological power of Soviet authority is strongest today in areas beyond the frontiers of Russia, beyond the reach of its police power. This phenomenon brings to mind a comparison used by Thomas Mann in his great novel Buddenbrooks. Observing that human institutions often show the greatest outward brilliance at a moment when inner decay is in reality farthest advanced, he compared one of those stars whose light shines most brightly on this world when in reality it has long since ceased to exist. And who can say with assurance that the strong light still cast by the Kremlin on the dissatisfied peoples of the western world is not the powerful afterglow of a constellation which is in actuality on the wane? This cannot be proved. And it cannot be disproved. But the possibility remains (and in the opinion of this writer it is a strong one) that Soviet power, like the capitalist world of its conception, bears within it the seeds of its own decay, and that the sprouting of these seeds is well advanced.<br><br>

Part IV<br><br>

It is clear that the United States cannot expect in the foreseeable future to enjoy political intimacy with the Soviet regime. It must continue to regard the Soviet Union as a rival, not a partner, in the political arena. It must continue to expect that Soviet policies will reflect no abstract love of peace and stability, no real faith in the possibility of a permanent happy coexistence of the Socialist and capitalist worlds, but rather a cautious, persistent pressure toward the disruption and, weakening of all rival influence and rival power.<br><br>

Balanced against this are the facts that Russia, as opposed to the western world in general, is still by far the weaker party, that Soviet policy is highly flexible, and that Soviet society may well contain deficiencies which will eventually weaken its own total potential. This would of itself warrant the United States entering with reasonable confidence upon a policy of firm containment, designed to confront the Russians with unalterable counter-force at every point where they show signs of encroaching upon he interests of a peaceful and stable world.<br><br>

But in actuality the possibilities for American policy are by no means limited to holding the line and hoping for the best. It is entirely possible for the United States to influence by its actions the internal developments, both within Russia and throughout the international Communist movement, by which Russian policy is largely determined. This is not only a question of the modest measure of informational activity which this government can conduct in the Soviet Union and elsewhere, although that, too, is important. It is rather a question of the degree to which the United States can create among the peoples of the world generally the impression of a country which knows what it wants, which is coping successfully with the problem of its internal life and with the responsibilities of a World Power, and which has a spiritual vitality capable of holding its own among the major ideological currents of the time. To the extent that such an impression can be created and maintained, the aims of Russian Communism must appear sterile and quixotic, the hopes and enthusiasm of Moscow's supporters must wane, and added strain must be imposed on the Kremlin's foreign policies. For the palsied decrepitude of the capitalist world is the keystone of Communist philosophy. Even the failure of the United States to experience the early economic depression which the ravens of the Red Square have been predicting with such complacent confidence since hostilities ceased would have deep and important repercussions throughout the Communist world.<br><br>

By the same token, exhibitions of indecision, disunity and internal disintegration within this country have an exhilarating effect on the whole Communist movement. At each evidence of these tendencies, a thrill of hope and excitement goes through the Communist world; a new jauntiness can be noted in the Moscow tread; new groups of foreign supporters climb on to what they can only view as the band wagon of international politics; and Russian pressure increases all along the line in international affairs.<br><br>
<a href= "link07.html">少看电视多看书</a><br><br>

It would be an exaggeration to say that American behavior unassisted and alone could exercise a power of life and death over the Communist movement and bring about the early fall of Soviet power in Russia. But the United States has it in its power to increase enormously the strains under which Soviet policy must operate, to force upon the Kremlin a far greater degree of moderation and circumspection than it has had to observe in recent years, and in this way to promote tendencies which must eventually find their outlet in either the breakup or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power. For no mystical, Messianic movement -- and particularly not that of the Kremlin -- can face frustration indefinitely without eventually adjusting itself in one way or another to the logic of that state of affairs.<br><br>

Thus the decision will really fall in large measure in this country itself. The issue of Soviet-American relations is in essence a test of the overall worth of the United States as a nation among nations. To avoid destruction the United States need only measure up to its own best traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation.<br><br>

Surely, there was never a fairer test of national quality than this. In the light of these circumstances, the thoughtful observer of Russian-American relations will find no cause for complaint in the Kremlin's challenge to American society. He will rather experience a certain gratitude to a Providence which, by providing the American people with this implacable challenge, has made their entire security as a nation dependent on their pulling themselves together and accepting the responsibilities of moral and political leadership that history plainly intended them to bear.<br><br>

从 X 到 Z：西方“苏联学”的兴与衰<br><br>

 

  

于 滨  《俄罗斯研究》2011年第1期 <br><br>
 
 西方的“苏联学”是一个庞大和繁杂的体系。在西方/美国的“苏联学”、西方国际关系理论、以及美国对苏政策三者之间寻找交叉点和互动处，有助于为进一步研究冷战以后西方的俄罗斯/欧亚研究和对俄政策奠定基础。乔治・凯南和马丁・马里亚分别于 1947 年和 1990 年以“X”和“Z”为笔名发表的长文，不仅代表了战后西方苏联研究的起点和终结，也构成了学界与政策界、地区研究与国际关系理论研究之间的交叉和互动点。在前苏联问题上，学界与政策界的互动不一定合拍，有时甚至南辕北辙。43 年间，美国的对苏政策一直具有极其强烈的意识形态色彩， 信奉现实主义的凯南被边缘化，美情报界也因此对苏屡屡误判。相比之下，西方苏联学界的主流却日益学术化，多以“正常”眼光看待前苏联，其中不乏马里亚认为的“亲苏”倾向；Z 文对前苏联的笔伐和近乎完美的预测，其实也是对西方和美国苏联学的大批判，尽管这一批判在一定程度上不甚公平。<br><br>

一、问题的提出<br><br>

1989 年，象征着传统东西方政治、经济和意识形态分野的柏林墙顷刻之间倒塌，欧亚大陆的地缘政治格局全盘重新洗牌。然而，“历史”并未像西方自由主义者所断定的那样就此“终结”。欧亚大陆各类民族主义滋生繁衍，其惯性和冲击力不仅继续支配欧亚大陆“后共产主义”制度/地区的政治生态，同时也极大地影响着欧洲本身的政治―经济整合、欧盟与俄国的关系以及美俄关系。在“9・11”和国际金融危机的强烈冲击下，横跨欧亚大陆的俄罗斯也在亲西方的理想、自由主义和更为传统的欧亚主义（Eurasianism）之间摇摆和探索，寻求一条适合自身国情的发展道路。欧亚大陆未来的政治走向前景如何？欧亚大陆最大的政治实体俄罗斯如何应对 其“渴望”又不可及的西方？基本上错过了西方主导的全球化“良性”运作时期的俄罗斯如何摆脱目前全球化的“厄运”期？美国主导的西方又会怎样对待一个劫后重生、欲振乏力但雄心未泯的俄罗斯？美国和欧洲如何看待一个与其若即若离的俄国？什么样的俄罗斯更符合美欧的利益？俄罗斯又如何自我定位？一个在西方化与俄罗斯化之间永久徘徊的俄罗斯到底是正常还是反常？这对欧亚大陆的地缘政治走向又意味着什么？西方俄罗斯研究与西方对俄政策之间有何种联系和互动？<br><br>

冷战以后西方的俄罗斯/欧亚研究和对俄政策，是冷战期间“苏联学”的继承和发展。本文的任务是对西方/美国的“苏联学”研究进行梳理，并将其置于西方国际关系研究的理论框架中加以比较和考察，同时兼顾美国对苏政策的制订和走向，以寻找三者之间的交叉点和互动之处，以期为进一步研究冷战以后西方的俄罗斯/欧亚研究和对俄政策提供一个基础。
<br><br>
二、X 先生与“苏联学”（Sovietology）<br><br>

冷战后美国和西方的俄罗斯研究，对冷战时期的“苏联研究”有继承也有扬弃。从苏联到俄罗斯的转型剧变，对西方的苏联/俄罗斯研究和政策制订，以及西方国际关系理论研究，都造成了强有力的震荡和冲击。二战后西方“苏联学”研究之拐点，一般要追溯到乔治・凯南（George Kennan）1947 年在美国《外交季刊》上以“X”笔名发表的“苏联行为之根源”（“The Sourcesof the Soviet Conduct”）一文。[1]该文提出的“遏制”观念，不但被杜鲁门政府立即转化为美国冷战时期的对苏政策，也影响了几代西方苏联学学者。冷战期间，西方倾注了大量的人力物力，在学界、政策界和政府部门设立了众多的“苏联研究”项目和机构。政府的外交、国际事务高官中也多有研究苏联问题的重量级学者，如基辛格（尼克松、福特政府）、布热津斯基（卡特政府）、赖斯（小布什政府）等。[2]
<br><br>
不仅如此，战后美国和西方国际关系理论的拓展，在相当程度上也借助了苏联研究的动力和资源，前苏联作为一个超级大国在国际体系中的角色[3]还是立足于国际体系、高屋建瓴的华尔兹（Kenneth Waltz）的结构现实主义（或新现实主义，structural or neo-realism），[4]均与苏联在二战后崛起、成为与美国相抗衡的超级强国有关。而在七十年代出现风靡一时的所谓“极派”（polarity）学者，更是与中苏两个意识形态和政治体系相同的大国由结盟转向对抗、并因此产生了中―美―苏“大三角”关系、在以往泾渭分明的国际两极体制之外开拓了“三度”的想象和操作空 间有关。[5]<br><br>

总之，前苏联的盛与衰，催生了西方国际关系学的大批理论性著作，其中包括约翰・盖迪斯（John Gaddis）的“持久和平论”（long peace），[6]弗朗西斯・福山的“历史终结论”，[7]亨廷顿的“文明冲突论”等。[8]甚至冷战结束以后开始成气候的建构主义，也是建立在对现实主义和自由主义的批评之上的。而批评的矛头所向，就是这两个学派都未能预见到苏联的解体。[9]建构主义对主流学派的批评不无道理，但在苏联问题上误判误导的绝不仅仅是学术界。美国情报界和决策界也未能预见强大的苏联会突然解体。中情局资深苏联 问题专家罗伯特・盖茨（后任中情局局长、现任国防部长）在 1986 年戈尔巴乔夫执政初期就曾坚持认为，戈尔巴乔夫本人及其政策毫无新意（“nothing new”），“在苏联只有暴政才能行得通（The Soviet Union is a despotism that works）”；全然没有察觉到戈尔巴乔夫与众不同的能力和致命的施政弱点，及其在以后的几年里给苏联政治和社会带来的巨变。拥有众多类似盖茨这样的“苏联通”的中情局，因此也只是年复一年地编织着苏联强国强军的神话，直到编不下去为止。[10]苏联问题研究是美国外国问题研究领域中投入最多的项目，但其最终结果却远不如人意。这种投入产出完全不成比例的现象，与美国情报界 10 年以后未能预测到“9・11”恐怖袭击的背景完全不同。当时以小布什总统为首的美国决策界和情报界几乎完全忽视了恐怖主义的滋生蔓延。[11]<br><br>

<a href= "link09.html">清华和复旦：外交宗派</a><br><br>


“9・11”前的几个月，小布什总统的注意力实际是在俄、中两国――2001 年 3 月驱逐 50 余名俄国间谍、4 月 1 日中美军机相撞，可以证明这一点。<br><br>

美国的苏联问题研究与美国国际关系研究有密切关系，但美国对苏政策的制订和实施似乎有自身的逻辑和惯性，二者之间的关系是复杂的和不断变化的。简单地认为美国学界和政策界之间是无数的“旋转门”（revolving doors）――即学者与政府官员和智库人士经常转换位置，互相配合――进而认定学界与政府之间的“共生”关系，可能是过于武断的推论。<br><br>

一般来说，中情局如此“钟情”甚至迷信前苏联的“长治久安”，其主要目的之一很可能是为了美国国内军工集团的利益而塑造一个强大的对手，以便使自身的利益最大化。这种政治化的情报当然无法客观和精确。对于中情局夸大苏联实力的做法，居然还有人匪夷所思地认为，该局在对苏分析中的“盲点”是前苏联谍报机构在中情局内部长期卧底的间谍阿尔德瑞奇・艾姆斯（Aldrich Ames）所造成的。在最高决策层面，老布什本人从内心不希望戈尔巴乔夫失败。而他的国务卿贝克及其助手对苏联事务的了解几乎是一张白纸。相比之下，其前任舒尔茨国务卿和他的副手们则精通对苏事务。贝克本人出身律师，擅长言辞和谈判，但对历史和地区事务知之甚少，对苏联的突变当然缺乏直觉。[12]
<br><br>
其实，决策者所需要的不一定是非常专业化的知识，而是战略眼光和对历史的把握。在这一点上，美国第四任总统詹姆斯・麦迪逊（James Madison）早在 1821 就对俄国日后的发展有言在先：<br><br>

很难设想……俄国未来的扩展仍然会一帆风顺。如果俄国不能教化那些居 住在俄国统治所伸延到的天涯海角的游牧族类，这些被征服的部族就算不给俄国添乱，也不会给俄国帮忙。而教化这些部族的过程又会使俄国成为一个膨胀过度的帝国，它必然会重蹈历史上无数帝国最终分崩离析的覆辙。[13]<br><br>

麦迪逊的先见之明是建立在类似“物极必反”的常识基础之上的。他虽然不可能精确预测前苏联解体的具体时间，但对苏联帝国的长远走向显然有相当的洞察力，至少避免了中情局众多“苏联问题专家”们的双重错误：戈尔巴乔夫执政初期不相信他会改革，而在戈氏执政后期则低估了改革的风险。<br><br>

三、Z 先生的“苏联必亡论”<br><br>

中情局的失误不是偶然的。苏联剧变前夕，西方和美国研究苏联问题的主流沉浸在戈尔巴乔夫改革所引发的亢奋和企望之中，对戈尔巴乔夫执政后期（1990-1991年）陆续出台的激进改革政策所遇到的阻力以及伴生的风险毫无察觉。甚至有学者在戈尔巴乔夫激进改革开始之前就宣布西方已经胜利，可以高枕无忧了。[14]<br><br>

在西方政府、媒体和学界为戈尔巴乔夫的改革齐唱赞歌时，美国的一家名为《代达罗斯》(Daedalus)的人文学术杂志在 1990 年冬季号发表了一篇署名“Z”的长文，指出苏联的极权体制必定会走向灭亡，而戈氏改革只会加剧这一进程。对“苏联问题”和国 际关系学界来说，该文的署名“Z”立刻使人联想到凯南当年以“X”笔名为冷战“定调”的长文，在西方和美国造成了轰动效应。[15]<br><br>

在这篇题为“通向斯大林的墓地”的文章中，Z 先生严厉斥责西方苏联学界对戈尔巴乔夫改革一厢情愿的盲目乐观(第 296-301 页)，指出了前苏联制度的“不可改革性”，原因是苏联制度不是一般的官僚体制，而是以意识形态构成的意识形态―官僚体系（ideocracy）；任何背离这一体系的举动都会引起连锁反应，牵一发而动全身；因此，苏联的问题不是如何改革其共产主义制度，而是如何使之解体（dismantling，第 337 页），而戈尔巴乔夫的改革就是自掘坟墓。[16]<br><br>

Z 的真实身份是加州大学伯克利分校的苏联历史学教授马丁・马里亚（MartinMalia），[17]使用匿名是为了保护为此文提供消息的前苏联人士。在西方对戈尔巴乔夫及其改革的一片赞歌中，马里亚在苏联解体近两年前做出极为悲观的预测，似乎有“众人皆醉，唯我独醒”的洞察力。Z 文的论述基于两点：对前苏联历史系统和细微的观察，以及对西方苏联学主流的强力批判。在马里亚看来，在苏联解体前的 20 余年里，西方苏联学的主流学者及其各种“理论”已经在相当程度上成了苏联集权制度的辩护士；他们看到的只是制度表面的超稳定性[18]，认为苏联体制已逐步过度到“成熟的工业社会”，甚至具有“向多元社会发展的潜力”，全然忽视了前苏联社会变迁所经历的巨大震荡和付出的沉痛代价。<br><br>

据马里亚观察，六十年代中期以来，西方的苏联学界对二战以后一直占据苏联研究主导地位的“集权模式”（totalitarian model）进行了数次“修正”，以加强对社会和经济等“底层问题”的研究，却忽视了对集权模式所特有的意识形态和政治等“高层问题”的专注，即以“社会研究”（social studies）取代了“政权研究”(regime studies)。[19]<br><br>

在这些被修正了的、非集权化的模式中，西方的苏联学界几乎把前苏联描述成了具有西方民主特点的政体，认为苏联模式虽然是从乌托邦开始，但经历了城市化和教育普及后，最终发展到了“现代化”。[20]根据这种逻辑，斯大林的“暴政”不过是过眼烟云（a passing phase），或一个“非正常”现象（anaberration）；在勃列日涅夫时期，苏联实际上恢复到了所谓“正常状态”（normalcy）。与此同时，勃列日涅夫时期还出现了所谓“机构性多元主义”（institutionalpluralism），苏联军方、企业管理阶层、或科学院学者，都可以通过多元方式表达各[21]最令马里亚反感的，是西方苏联学界中有人把斯大林时代描写成由一个从下至上、由“恐怖社会”经过“进步”发展，达到社会“流动”（terror, progress,and social mobility）的“民主现象”，使得勃列日涅夫一代领导人能够由底层脱颖而出，[22]等等。他认为，西方苏联学主流未能透过表象看到前苏联极权主义的本质（第300 页），过分注重前苏联集权政治的程度和数量（degree and quantity），而非本质和质量（nature and quality）。在马里亚看来，尽管戈尔巴乔夫对前苏联体制动了大手术，但该体制的基本内核（党政体系、中央计划、警察系统、党务系统等）基本上得以延续（第 301 页）。<br><br>

作为苏联史学家，马里亚认为要真正把握现状和洞察未来，必须以史为鉴。首先，布尔什维克革命是基于乌托邦式的理念。之所以“侥幸”成功，是由于俄国在一战期间的深度危机。革命后苏俄实行战时共产主义，以政治委员制度加强对沙俄旧军队的控制，以政治警察（或契卡）来打击布尔什维克的一切“敌人”。在1917-1920 年间，有 1500 万到 1900 万俄国人死于战乱、饥荒和疾病，其中主要原因是布尔什维克的乌托邦式的奢望和执政不力（第 305-310 页）。三十年代的苏联经济高速发展和 1929-1935 年代强制性集体农庄运动，造成了 600 万到 1100 万人死亡；3000 万农民迁入城市从事工业生产，农业生产力因此遭受严重破坏，农村生活水平倒退至 1913 年以前的水平，俄国由一战前欧洲的“粮仓”沦为谷物净进口国，至今元气尚未恢复。<br><br>

在工业方面，前苏联政府发布的三十年代的年经济增长率为 20%；然而在戈尔巴乔夫时期，西方经济学界估计这一时期的经济增长率仅为 4-6%。[23]此外，斯大林时代的经济增长极为畸形，绝大部分是集中在重工业领域，农业、轻工业和服务业几乎没有发展。整个苏联经济犹如一个庞大的军工联合体（military-industrialcomplex，第 312 页）。而确保这一庞大体系运行的则是 1936-1938 年间斯大林的“大恐怖”(Great Terror)，以此来制止任何可能对其农业政策和“一五计划”的怀疑和批评。马里亚援引西方和前苏联学者的统计，从 1936 年到 1953 年斯大林去世，“大恐怖”的受害者可能高达 1000 万，而这还是比较保守的统计。[24]<br><br>

在这千万人的受害者中，包括 80%的苏军军官（第 314 页）。苏军受到如此重创，为何还能在二战中击败德军？马里亚认为是“地利”的原因：苏联幅员辽阔，斯大林有足够空间去换取时间，使希特勒自己犯错误而步步走向失败；同时苏联有 时间转移大量军工企业，保存实力，并伺机反击。卫国战争的胜利，使苏共政权拥有了新的合法性；四十年代末的原子弹、五十年代末的人造卫星、七十年代与美国实现了核均势……，这一切华丽的表象，在很大程度上掩盖了苏联计划经济体制中的粗糙内涵。这种高投入高产出的粗放经济，建立在对资源和人力大量消耗、不计成本的基础之上，在工业化和战时可以有傲人的业绩，但在高、深层次的经济发展阶段就日渐乏力。到七十年代末，苏联的发展模式达到巅峰。1979 年苏军入侵阿富汗。同年，苏联的经济增长为零（第 316-319 页）。<br><br>

后斯大林时代被马里亚划分为赫鲁晓夫的解冻期（thaw）、勃列日涅夫的停滞期(stagnation)、以及戈尔巴乔夫的改革期。对赫鲁晓夫来说，在政治上清算斯大林似乎并不难，一纸秘密报告就可拨乱反正，纠正冤假错案也可一挥而就。然而赫鲁晓夫面临的最大难题是如何改革前苏联盘根错节的官僚体系。在马里亚看来，恰恰是因为赫鲁晓夫在三个方面触动了苏联官僚体制的最敏感处，最终导致其下台。首先，赫鲁晓夫把经济决策权下放到新成立的“地区经济委员会”（Regional EconomicCouncils, Sovnarkhozes），从而削减了中央部门的权限。与此同时，赫鲁晓夫又把党务系统分为主管农业和工业的两部分，引起众人反对。最令人难以接受的，是赫鲁晓夫力图对重要的党内职务的任期加以规范和限制，触动了一大批党内高层人士的根本利益。赫鲁晓夫在这些国内政策上的失分，甚至超过了古巴导弹危机，最后墙倒众人推（第 320 页）。<br><br>

勃列日涅夫当政的 18 年（1964-1982）在戈尔巴乔夫时期被称为“停滞期”。其政策走向包括停止非斯大林化，因为过分贬低斯大林不利于政治稳定；虽然勃列日涅夫政权从未以官方名义恢复斯大林的名誉，但停止了赫鲁晓夫时期对“个人迷信”的攻击。在经济方面，由于工业部门的反对，柯西金总理试图用以某种有限的权力下放提高生产效率的政策也裹足不前，工人对工作没有积极性，得过且过，经济效益低下；与此同时，“地下”经济却大行其道，最终导致相当的经济管理部门、党务系统、甚至执法部门“黑社会化”(Mafiaization)。到八十年代初，随着前苏联执政的老人们一个接着一个地被埋葬在克里姆林宫墙脚下，整个苏联的体制已病入膏肓，滑向一座巨大的斯大林式的墓地。
<br><br>
在马里亚看来，医治这些制度上的痼疾，挽救这一垂死的机体，对经历了 18 年“停滞期”以后上任的戈尔巴乔夫来说，从一开始就注定是一场以悲剧（drama）收场的改革尝试。然而，戈氏还是知难而进，对已经不可救药的政治、经济体制施以“重建”（perestroika）、“透明化”（glasnost）和民主化“三板斧”。戈尔巴乔夫的重建政策始于 1985 年 4 月，目标是为举步维艰的苏联经济打一剂强心针，以加速经济发展；为此，戈尔巴乔夫问计于专家学者，以自上而下的行政手段对政府经济部门进行改组和合并，撤换了一大批官员；同时在全国范围内开展反酗酒运动，实行质量检验制度。然而这一切均未能重振经济，反而适得其反：反酗酒运动迫使伏特加的销售转入地下，国家失去了一大笔收入；质量检查制度使大批企业完不成利 润计划，收入下降；机构调整和人事变动又使各级官员人心浮动，惶惶不可终日。到 1986 年秋，戈尔巴乔夫的各项“重建”政策均遇到重重阻力。不得已，戈尔巴乔夫发起了“透明化”运动（glasnost），力图通过知识界和舆论，营造开放、改革的气氛，对体制内的官僚体系和僵硬的思维方式施加压力。戈尔巴乔夫甚至亲自打电话给正被流放的萨哈罗夫（前苏联主要持不同政见者），请他“出山”并保证其言论自由，希望他能为改革推波助澜。其结果是苏联的政治生态急剧分化，自由/改革派的交锋日益白热化，来自反改革派的阻力也越来越强。保守派的领军人物利加乔夫（Ligachev）指责说，自由知识分子的批评会使苏联的体系、传统和价值观念毁于一旦（到 1989 年，前苏联的几乎所有政治和价值观念都受到公开指责、批判和诋毁）。对此，戈氏的改革派认为，不存在除了重建以外的任何其他选择；如果苏联经济继续停滞，苏联会很快失去其超级大国的地位，以致亡党亡国。到 1989 年初，由“透明化”运动引发的改革和保守派之间的辩论白热化，并在苏联的政治和知识精英中造成强烈的危机感。<br><br>

戈尔巴乔夫改革的最大败笔是打开了遍及苏联各地的分裂、分离运动的闸门。就在改革、保守两派争论不休、苏联经济每况愈下时，前苏联除俄罗斯以外的各加盟共和国的分离倾向日趋明显。从 1988 年初到 1989 年，在亚美尼亚、波罗的海各加盟共和国、格鲁吉亚、阿塞拜疆和乌克兰，来自底层的分离运动与经济保障、政治民主、个人自由的各种诉求合为一股力量，严重地动摇了各地党政机构权力的合法性；戈尔巴乔夫的“透明化”运动实际上对各地的分离运动起到了推波助澜的作用，而这一切是改革的始作俑者始料不及的。马里亚认为，前苏联领导人之所以错判形势，是由于俄罗斯中心主义（Russocentric）的自大和天真。诚然，俄国在二十世上半叶已攫取了周边大片疆土，但俄国人在这些地区统治的合法性一直是个问题。戈氏大刀阔斧的改革措施目的是要削弱中央官僚体制，而这不可避免地会导致对周边地区控制的削弱。这本来是一个常识问题（第 325-326 页），但戈尔巴乔夫却完全忽视了民族分离、分裂的危险。<br><br>

“重建”苏联经济未果，推动政治“透明”遇阻，戈尔巴乔夫最后在 1989-1990年启动激进的民主化进程，以期解开苏联政治、经济的死结。根据马里亚的观察，1989 年的民主选举苏维埃人民代表产生了一个意想不到的后果，即一向令人生畏的苏共一夜之间开始惧怕平民百姓了（第 327 页）。在 1989 年 5-6 月间，苏联电视台在两个星期里实况转播最高苏维埃代表会议，自由派和民主派的代表实际上把大会变成了对苏共进行控诉和批判的大会。与此同时，大会并未就困难重重的经济、社会问题提出任何有效的解决方案。到了 7 月份，苏联各地开始出现各种形式的公民社团，实际上开始干预和管理地方事务。至此，戈尔巴乔夫的改革进入死胡同。其结果是旧制度瓦解的速度远超过新体制建立的速度，或者说破旧而未立新。更确切地说，1989 年苏联的问题是旧制度拒绝死亡，而新制度无力出生。到当年秋季，莫斯科已有政变的传闻（第 331-332 页）。至此，前苏联制度的解体只是时间问题了。马里亚的这篇文章止笔于 1989 年底（Daedalus 杂志 1990 年 1 月号），离莫斯科的“8・19”政变还有 20 个月。事态的发展从多方面验证了其逻辑和预测的准确性，正如马里亚在该文一开始引用法国作家托克维尔（Alexis de Tocqueville）的名言：“对于一个坏政府来说，最危险的时刻就是它开始改革之日（The most dangerous timefor a bad government is when it starts to reform itself）”。而在这同时，西方苏联学的主流仍陶醉在对戈氏改革的赞歌之中，中情局也仍在编织苏军强大的神话，美国高 层仍对戈尔巴乔夫的改革寄予厚望。<br><br>

四、X 与 Z：非主流派的沉浮<br><br>

从凯南冷战宣言式的“X”长文，到苏联解体前夕马里亚的“Z”调“挽歌”，西方/美国的苏联学走过了 43 年轰轰烈烈的历程。在政府、军方、情报界、学界和私人的合力下，形成了美国“外国研究”（foreign studies）最庞大的“国别/地区研究”（country/area studies）体系，同时也对西方/美国的国际关系理论产生了巨大影响，二者之交叉、借鉴和互补，几乎难分彼此，构成战后西方国际关系研究最重要的环节。由此产生的众多国际关系理论的框架，反过来又影响着苏联研究的发展。 X 的身份是外交官，Z 则终身执教。两篇文章发表时间相差近半个世纪，但都文笔犀利，逻辑严密；谈古论今，一气呵成；不仅有论述，也有政策建议。虽然二人侧重点不同（凯南侧重苏联的外部行为；马里亚则聚焦于苏联内政），“X”“Z”二文在西方繁缛枯燥、过分学究式的书山学海中，都有相当的可读性。在方法论上，二人都是从历史看现实，透过现象看本质。虽然都因发表匿名文章而名声在外，然- 79 -而二人在各自领域（政策界和学界）内却均不得志。凯南出名后，美国外交界和政 策界日益强烈的意识形态化，使他倍感忧虑又无回天之力，只好自我“流放”到学界。马里亚在成名前的几十年间也难以苟同学界四平八稳的实证主义流派，于是对苏联的看法日趋极端政治化和意识形态化。<br><br>

凯南与马里亚的为学和个人境遇虽有一些相似之处，但在对前苏联体制和行为的认知方面，二人几乎是南辕北辙。<br><br>

马里亚对前苏联政治史和政治制度的描述和分析有强烈的价值观取向，对前苏联的共产主义制度有刻骨仇恨。与事事考证、自我标榜价值中立的西方社会科学主流的经验主义（empiricism）完全不同，倒是与前苏联持不同政见者的观点更为相近。 二战以后，西方苏联学一度由“集权主义”模式主导；此后社会科学的发展陆续开辟 了 众 多 的 模 式 ， 比 如 发 展 理 论 （ developmentalism ） 、 官 僚 / 机 构 模 式（bureaucratic-institutionalist approach）、利益集团（interest group）研究等。这些治学路径（approaches）和方法论被陆续引进苏联学，对传统的集权模式造成强烈冲击，并从六十年代起逐步取得了主导地位。在西方的苏联史学界，普林斯顿大学的斯蒂芬・科恩（Stephen F. Cohen）1980 年出版的《布哈林传》[25]，以及影响了西方整整一代新左派的伊萨克・戴舍尔（Isaac Deutscher）三卷本的《托洛斯基传》[26]，对苏联共产主义制度本身并不完全否定，而是认为苏联有可能回到类似二十年代那种更为人道的新经济政策的政治环境。<br><br>

事实上，西方苏联学在六十年代“转向”、致力于寻找和发掘一个“正常的”苏联，这与西方尤其是美国内部的政治走向息息相关。二十世纪六、七十年代的美国深陷越战，经济不振；国内政治危机重重，暗杀成风（肯尼迪总统和民权运动领袖马丁・路德・金分别于 1963 年和 1968 年遇刺身亡），民权和反战运动高涨，美国制度的合法性受到严重挑战。与此同时，作为美国制度对立面的苏联似乎蒸蒸日上，对西方左派和自由派人士有强烈的吸引力。像戴舍尔这样探求人性化共产主义的学者，在学界和战后“婴儿潮”一代人中的影响力剧增。西方/美国学界一直由中间偏左的自由派占据，乃是六、七十年代新左派运动的惯性使然。而在西方知识界向左转的大潮中，马里亚认为根本不存在人性化的共产主义。在他看来，列宁的新经济政策不过是通向集权的第一步，戈尔巴乔夫主义不过是这一制度的最后挣扎而已。[27]<br><br>

这种“极端的”、非学术的观点，在西方的苏联学界无疑属于“另类”，并一直被边缘化。[28]<br><br>

在此种大环境下，马里亚一生的大部分时间都在与学界那些他认 为只注重表象的经验主义学派缠斗，而最终以 Z 文震动学、政界。两年后苏联解体，马里亚从伯克利退休，功成名遂。<br><br>

五、苏联之命运：在必然与偶然之间<br><br>

马里亚虽然相对准确地预见到了苏联的解体，但这更出于他的极端意识形态化的信念：即苏联的制度是邪恶的，而邪恶的制度是不可能持久的。事态的发展与其说验证了马里亚的预测，不如说是实现了他的企盼。在治学/研究方式方面，无论从历史或逻辑的角度，马里亚都并非无懈可击。从历史上看，前苏联的政治制度显然不是凭空产生的，其“集权”特征多多少少是承袭了俄国传统制度的特色。一直保 持到十九世纪中叶的农奴制在欧洲绝无仅有，而十九世纪下半叶的沙俄逐渐成为一个警察国家也是不争的事实。此外，马里亚一味淡化或贬低赫鲁晓夫“解冻”时期的历史意义，认为苏联制度本身并没有根本改变，从而断定该制度必定消亡。然而这并不能抹杀一个基本事实，即对前苏联绝大多数人来说，后斯大林时期政治运作的方式和制度的包容性，与斯大林时期相比是不可同日而语的。至少，斯大林时期人人自危的恐怖感已大为降低，一般民众和官员的日常生活开始了某种“正常化”。这些实实在在的变化是通过政策而非政体的改变而实现的，社会和民众所付出的代 价显然比革命性的变化要小得多。同样的道理，戈尔巴乔夫时期的苏联政治至少在体制内造成了前所未有的宽松环境。在对外政策方面，戈氏对东欧和阿富汗不仅仅是“撒手”，而且是一种在哲学上和道义上与前苏联以致俄罗斯传统的帝国理念告别。戈尔巴乔夫这样做是冒了极大的政治风险的，没有勇气和魄力的平庸之辈难有如此境界。而美国的政治精英在对周边小国和弱国的政策上，一直在实行门罗主义；不仅如此，后冷战时期的美国，实际上是将门罗主义放大到全世界。戈尔巴乔夫国内改革的最后失败是悲剧性的，但并不能因此断定其改革动机就 是为了维护在马里亚看来是“邪恶”的制度。戈氏改革裹足不前，最终失败，不仅有众多必然的和结构性的因素，而且不排除偶然因素。事实上，造成改革后期急转直下的局势是有多种变量的。社会变迁与自然界的变化不同，是不大可能加以精确[29]在更深的层次，马里亚在 Z 文中为前苏联的历次改革所设计的“要么不改革──要么打碎一切”的两个极端的结局，在相当程度上反映了西方主要思想流派的极端性。典型的西方自由主义和西方马克思主义，都力图严格按照自身的模式和逻辑改造世界，都追求各自体制的最高纯洁度和完美性，都拒绝第三条道路，都把不同意识形态之间的关系看作是零和游戏，毫无妥协的余地。马里亚的思维方式就是此种极端宗教性的、僵硬的意识形态的表现，也是违反常理的。现实是一个是充满灰色地带、黑白皆有、善恶混杂的“浑沌世界”。戈尔巴乔夫在内外政策上的改革，实际上走出了典型的西方意识形态的零和式思维。凯南的现实主义也排斥意识形态的极端性，可惜在美国难有容身之地。其实就是在马里亚执教的美国，宪法保护下的自由也一直是有条件的。马丁・路德・金所称的“沉默的大多数”（silent majority），在二战以后一直在容忍甚至纵容 美国的种族隔离政策。[30]<br><br>

事实上，美国的政治精英最终放弃种族隔离，实行平权政策（affirmative action），在很大程度上是为了在国际舞台上与前苏联争夺道德制高点。一个在美国看来是“邪恶帝国”（evil empire）的前苏联，客观上迫使美国向更民主、更平等的社会迈出了一大步。以此观之，戈氏改革的最大失败，是在国际体系层面造成严重失衡：侥幸获得单极世界霸主地位的美国，实际是在情不自禁地走向帝国。而且，它不仅在国际上为所欲为，在国内政策上也开倒车，开始逐步放弃很多对少数族裔的优惠政策。[31]与马里亚强烈的意识形态化和“先苦后甜”的经历相反，凯南则更注重前苏联[31]其实 X 文有两个版本。在 1946 年初凯南即将卸任美国驻苏使馆代办前发给华盛顿的 5300 字的“长电”中，把苏联对外政策的基础定义为“俄罗斯传统的和与生俱来的不安全感”，只是在俄国革命后，这种不安全感才与共产主义的意识形态相结合。[32]凯南的电文引起了对苏强硬派海军参谋长詹姆斯・福莱斯特（James Forrestal）的注意，他力促凯南将此电文公开发表，这就是后来发表在《外交季刊》1947 年 7 月号的 X 文。<br><br>

然而 X 文中，只是把共产主义的意识形态定位为苏联对外政策的根源，完全不提俄罗斯对外部世界的“传统”的不安全感，这当然包括十九世纪初拿破仑侵俄，更不用说不久前希特勒对苏联的入侵。无独有偶，X文发表前四个月，杜鲁门总统在对国会的演说中，也借用凯南的“遏制”概念，正式推出“杜鲁门主义”。在演说中，杜鲁门强调世界已分为自由与集权两大阵营，美国必须以 4 亿美元经援军援土耳其和希腊，以制止苏联对这两个国家的“侵略”。在演说中，杜鲁门也只字未提俄罗斯“传统”的不安全感，仅仅把苏联描绘成意识形态的洪水猛兽。凯南事后对杜鲁门政府的“断章取义”十分不满，认为杜鲁门主义严重歪曲了他的本意，由此引发的冷战过于意识形态化、过于强调武力的作用。他认为美国对希腊和土耳其的军援毫无必要，而且会挑衅苏联。<br><br>

不仅如此，凯南在以后近 60 年的余生里，致力于反对美国历届政府对外政策中日益军事化、意识形态化和泛道德化的趋向。[33]X 和 Z 文及其作者的经历，仅仅是美国和西方在冷战时期苏联研究巨大冰山的一角。虽然不可能也不应该代表这一领域中的“诸子百家”，然而却在不同时期以不同角度折射出这一领域中主要学派，以及这些理论与政策之间的关系。凯南和马里亚之间最大的不同，就是文章发表前后的个人经历和命运。凯南以 X 文出名，却因美国的对苏政策日益意识形态化而逐渐远离决策中心，几乎成为“体制外”人士。但他却仍坚持现实主义的观点，直到 2005 年辞世。Z 文的意义在于，走向斯大林墓地的不仅有苏联体制，还有伴随着这一体制的西方苏联学。美国的苏联学也由此改头换面为俄罗斯学或欧亚学（Eurasian studies）。六、理论、常识与决策凯南和马里亚二人的经历，还揭示了另一个问题，即美国的苏联研究与美国的对苏政策之间的“不同步”现象。美国/西方学界在六十年代以后逐步走向非意识形态化，至少主流是如此。与此同时，美国的对苏政策和整体外交政策，除了尼克松 政府的短暂时期，基本上都是意识形态化的。[34]究其原因，这既有无处不在的麦卡锡主义，也有“美国特殊主义”（American exceptionalism）的缘故。[35]美国已故的哥伦比亚大学历史学家理查德・霍斯泰德尔（Richard Hostadter）曾说：“美国作为一个国家，其命运不是有没有意识形态，美国本身就是意识形态的化身”(It has beenour fate as a nation not to have ideologies but to be one)。[36]<br><br>

在这一基础上，北卡大学历史学家马克・亨特（Michael Hunt）在《意识形态与美国外交》一书中，描述和分析 了美国意识形态的三个组成部分：1）民族自大情结（feeling of national greatness）；2）以种族和肤色来区别和看待他国人民；3）怀疑、惧怕和反对革命。[37]总之，作为一个没有深层文化的移民国家，美国必须以意识形态作为其民族凝聚力。[38]对于美国对外政策中非现实的和强烈的意识形态因素，美国现实派大师基辛格在“9・11”数月前出版的《美国还需要外交吗？》一书中认为，美国六、七十年代深陷越战而不能自拔，不是因为美国过度使用武力，而是由于美国过度推行其价值观。不考虑历史条件而滥用道德标准，只会造成更大的灾难。到了克林顿时期，美国除了军事和经济政策以外，已无真正的外交可言了。[39]一个拥有阵容最强大的国际关系学的国家何以“没有”了外交？拥有最庞大的苏联研究和最强大的情报系统的美国为何没有预见到苏联局势急转直下的可能？而这些失误与西方对苏联研究的投入根本不成比例。<br><br>

原因何在？是研究资料的问题还是判断有误？是价值观念的问题还是方法论的问题？其实美国学界和情报界的地区上述问题可以从多方解读。然而学界和政策界的“不对称性”至少可以说明一个问题，即有效的外交并不一定依赖学术理论的发展。在相当程度上，外交更是一门艺术而非学术，其成败取决于领袖人物和精英团体的战略洞察力，而非简单地依靠对对方的大规模的技术性侦查；是把握战略机遇的大智大勇，而非时时处处标榜自身、贬低他人的小动作和小聪明。<br><br>

而这些外交的艺术和智慧在美国的对苏和对外政策中，似乎是日益短缺。2009 年 1/2 月号的《国家利益杂志》刊登了安德鲁・克莱比奈维茨（Andrew Krepinevich）和白瑞・沃茨（Barry Watts）的题为“国家安全委员会里少了什么？”的文章，指出美国的国家安全和战略部门的战略判断力和决策力从七十年代就开始下降，这当然包括对苏联的评估、战略和政策。<br><br>

 相对来说，20 世纪前半叶，美国在国际社会以外交为主导，军事上后发制人，其业绩可圈可点。这包括 1900 年的对华“门户开放”政策，美国不费一枪一弹就获得了进入列强在华势力范围的权利，又在名义上维持了中国的“统一”；1905 年小罗斯福总统在日俄之间调停，因此而获得当年的诺贝尔和平奖，私下里又得到了日本对美国侵占菲律宾的认可；美国在一战各交战国筋疲力尽时介入欧战，1919 年又以民主和民族自决的道德制高点，打开了美国介入欧洲和国际事务的大门；甚至美国在 1941 年以前的中立政策，都是美国充分利用其独特的地缘战略资源，从交战各方攫取最大利益。为此，当时还是参议员的杜鲁门曾说：“如果我们看到德国占上风，我们就应帮俄国；如果俄国占上风，就要帮德国。让他们自相残杀好了，尽管我无论如何也不希望希特勒赢。”<br><br>

可以说，美国大战略意识衰落的拐点是越战。历时 11 年（1964-1975）、耗费万亿美元的越战，除了造成数百万的伤亡以外，美国所得到的唯一的“积极”遗产，恐怕只是历久不衰的百老汇保留剧目《西贡小姐》（Miss Saigon）。孜孜寻求敌人、刻意夸大对方实力，从来就是中情局的“职业病”。这包括肆意夸大前苏联的实力，断定萨达姆有大规模杀伤性武器等。与此同时，美国庞大的情报体系居然未能感受到“9・11”恐怖袭击前山雨欲来的种种迹象。就此，英国记者乔纳森・帕维尔(JonathanPower)在“9・11”三天过后一篇题为“世人皆知，只有美国蒙在鼓里”的文章中指出，恐怖袭击是针对美国在九十年代的一系列政策。美国在巴以冲突、全球温室效应、海外驻军、反导等一系列问题上唯我独尊的(take-it-or-leave-it attitude)处世方式，使美国处于自我毁灭(self destructive)的境地。帕维尔认为，美国对外政策的傲慢与偏见，不可避免地要遭受报复。任何政治运动都可能产生诉诸暴力的少数极端分子， 但这并不等于这些运动的主流是错误的，它们总是事出有因(elements of truth)。对此，全世界都看得清清楚楚，唯有美国由于其大部分政治领袖和媒体的自我封闭而蒙在鼓里，对“9・11”袭击大惑不解。[40]<br><br>

其实，国与国相处的最基本的原则还是“己所不欲，勿施于人”这句老话。在美国学界中，除古典现实主义（classic realism）以外，绝大多数令人眼花缭乱的理论、定义、假说和概念，似乎连这一基本常识都不具备。在美国的外交和对苏政策中，兼顾对方利益的想法和做法更是少见。对此，前国务卿基辛格说：“美国是对苏联对外干涉主义最严厉的批评者，但美国本身却从未接受过不干涉内政的原则。”[41]<br><br>

冷战期间，前苏联的核报复能力可能是唯一使美国保持自身行动平衡的清醒剂；而美国三权分立的内部结构，对美国的对外政策几乎没有什么制衡作用。[42]<br><br>

[29]苏军在戈尔巴乔夫改革后期“政治化”，表现出以下若干现象：（1）1989―90 年的选举改革，首次允许苏军参与推选军人代表参加选举并进入最高苏维埃。而在改革后期的动荡时期，军人代表往往“被迫”在不同的政治派别中进行选择。（2）由此导致一些少壮军官质疑甚至公开挑战上级。（3）1990 年初开始，苏军和苏内务部高级将领日益强烈要求对国内的分离主义倾向和动乱采取强硬措施，对戈尔巴乔夫的改革不满。事实上，苏军作为一个整体，早在 1980 年代中期就对戈尔巴乔夫的“新思维”不满，主要原因是从东欧撤军、与美国达成中导协议等，对苏军的利益和士气损 害极大。（4）俄罗斯联邦 1990 年总统选举中，两位总统竞选人叶利钦和尼古拉・瑞斯科夫（NikolaiRyshkov）的竞选搭档都是军人，苏军内部对戈尔巴乔夫改革的态度已呈分裂状态；政客也竞相拉拢军中派别以壮声势。（5）苏联党、政、社会日益深化的改革与保守的分歧，也在苏军内部日益显现，最终驱使苏军保守派于 1991 年 8 月 19 日发动政变；但苏军本身已经严重分裂，军中改革派随即反击，使政变迅速瓦解。详见 Yu Bin, “Civil-Military Relations in the Transition of Communism:China and Russia”, Current Politics and Economics of Russia, vol. 4, no. 3/4, New York: Nova Science,1995, pp. 237-246.了极大的不确定因素。

President Barack Obama has announced that he will ask Congress for $1 billion in funding to reassure U.S. allies in Europe who are shaken by Russia's recent aggression against Ukraine. Coupled with the president's speech in Warsaw, the $1 billion package is clearly intended to send a resounding signal that the United States takes the new Russian threat seriously and will not neglect its European allies for national security interests elsewhere in the world.

On the surface, $1 billion is an eye-catching sum, but measured in terms of overall U.S. defense spending, it is a mere drop in the bucket. How much will this $1 billion actually buy? Is it worth it? Will it make a difference in the long run?
<br><br>
When events in Ukraine took a turn for the worse back in February and March, NATO responded by deploying fighter aircraft and airborne warning and control systems (AWACS) to Eastern European allies. NATO ships steamed into the Black Sea and later toward the Baltics. The United States deployed a battalion of airborne rangers across Poland and the Baltic states.
<br><br>
Eastern allies exposed to Russian revanchism welcomed these reassurance measures. But the truth was that they were largely temporary, done for effect and symbolism, and did little to resolve the deeper problems that have sprung up in European security since Russia's annexation of Crimea.
<br><br>
Many factors limited the initial U.S. response. To begin with, some NATO allies doubt that the security environment in Europe has changed fundamentally and worry that NATO deployments might provoke Russia. No less important, the appropriate military response to the threat posed by Russia's sophisticated, unconventional strategy in Ukraine is elusive.
<br><br>
Above all, questions about U.S. resolve in Europe and have fed some allied concerns. In a speech in Brussels in March, President Obama affirmed the U.S. commitment to the security of its European allies, but doubts have lingered that the United States is ready and able to pony-up for European defense against a new, complicated threat from Moscow. At current funding levels, the United States would be hard pressed to maintain even the reassurance measures it has in place through the end of 2015.<br><br>

If approved by Congress, the $1 billion in funding would be a huge step in the right direction. It would allow the United States to expand existing commitments enormously and keep them up and running much longer. 
<br><br>
The graphic below shows what $1 billion actually buys in terms of troops, ships, and aircraft. It is not a paltry sum. Three notional packages ― and what they would cost on an annual basis ― are depicted.
<br><br>
As the graphic shows, $1 billion dollars won't fund new permanent bases in Europe, but it would allow for significant, persistent rotations of air, ground, and naval forces through the continent, and offer lots of leeway for additional robust military exercises.<br><br>

<a href= "pic01.html">美国军费开支（预算） </a><br><br>


The challenge posed by Russian revanchism will not be resolved by military means alone. It will require a sustained U.S. re-engagement with Europe that lasts far beyond the current crisis over Ukraine. That re-engagement needs to have political and military dimensions, and must be backed by parallel steps to engage and deter Russia simultaneously. Military measures, moreover, cannot be undertaken by the United States only.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, if the attention to the challenge posed by Russia dwindles as the immediate crisis in Ukraine fades out of the headlines, the problem will only get worse and more costly. A $1 billion investment will not solve the problem itself, but it's an important step in the right direction.

【内容提要】 乔治・凯南是美国著名的“苏联通”，也是美国“遏制政策”的提出者。1946 年他向美国发回长电，1947 年又发表 X 论文，分析苏联的思维方式和行为根源，在美国政坛和民众中引起震动。时隔半个多世纪，我们再分析凯南的这两篇文章，仍被他惊人的洞察力和预言所折服。他对苏联的民族性格、苏联外交的行为方式有着深刻理解，他的这一认识正是建立在对俄罗斯( 苏联) 历史文化的深刻认识的基础之上。

<br><br>
一 凯南长电与 X 文章出笼的历史背景<br><br>

二战期间，美苏联手应对德国法西斯的进攻，雅尔塔和波茨坦会议奠定了美苏联合共管世界的格局。随着罗斯福的去世和杜鲁门成为美国总统，美国政府对苏联的态度发生根本性的变化。杜鲁门及其谋士认为，“罗斯福的想法并不现实，美国无法用一些政治上的让步或经济上的援助将苏联纳入它的战略轨道”[1]，而应该另谋对策。1945 年 9 月伦敦五国外长会议前夕，美国政府决定发动对苏强硬外交。外交官凯南当时也表示“从未认为苏联是我国合适的盟友或伙伴，无论是现实的，还是潜在的”[2]。
<br><br>
1946 年 2 月 9 日，斯大林在莫斯科选区的选民大会上发表演说，谈到战争的发生是现代垄断资本主义基础上世界各种经济力量和政治力量斗争的必然结果。斯大林暗示，和平的国际秩序是不可能长期维持的，苏联必须做好准备，包括增加重工业生产，以防万一。在当时美苏关系的气氛下这篇演说在美国引起了异乎寻常的反应。美国最高法官威廉・道格拉斯声称，斯大林的演说是第三次世界大战的宣言[3]。
<br><br>
时任美国驻苏联大使馆代办的凯南接到美国国务院在 1946 年 2 月 2 日发给他的征询意见的电报，要求他对苏联不愿意参加世界银行和国际货币基金组织的行为动机进行分析。之后，凯南向美国国务院发回了一份长达 5 542 字的英文电报。他没有仅限于斯大林的一番讲话，而是从苏联的思维方式和苏联行为的根源以及华盛顿应如何对策的角度发表了自己的见解。凯南“综合了美国政府前一时期在实施对苏联强硬外交中的一些实际做法和主要决策人的一些设想，并从理论的高度进行证明，提出了所谓的遏制战略”[4]，但暂时没有使用“遏制”一词。
<br><br>
1946 年 12 月，海军部长弗莱斯特尔给凯南一篇关于马克思主义与苏联政权的文章，要他进行评论。凯南更愿意自己写一篇有关这一问题的文章。不久，凯南便向弗莱斯特尔递交了一篇题为“苏联对外政策心理背景”的文章。1947 年 1月，凯南在该文的基础上，在美国对外关系协会的一次小型讨论会上作了一个题为“苏联的思维方式及其对苏联对外政策的影响”的演讲。《外交》季刊编辑汉密尔顿・阿姆斯特朗向凯南索要文稿，凯南征得弗莱斯特尔的同意，并经国务院非官方出版物委员会的审查，将文章交给《外交》季刊，要求匿名发表。所以这篇“苏联行为的根源”因其署名为“X”，而被称之为“X”文章[5]。凯南在这一文章中明确地提出了“遏制”这一战略。此后，凯南进一步提出了遏制苏联的政策建议，包括制定马歇尔计划等。44 年后苏联解体，人们回过头来看美国对苏联的政策，足见凯南“异常敏感的洞察力和惊人的预见力”[6]。不管凯南提出的遏制思想是政治遏制，还是军事遏制，“遏制之父”之名已经奠定了凯南在外交史上的地位。<br><br>

二 从文化视角解读凯南的文章<br><br>

通常人们都是从国际关系学的角度分析凯南的遏制思想。国内学界就凯南的遏制思想是“军事遏制”，还是“政治遏制”在 20 世纪 90 年代有过激烈的争论。要研究凯南的“洞察力和预见 力”，选择从文化的角度剖析凯南的这两篇文章也许更有价值。尤其是从苏联对立国的学者、政治活动家如何从文化心理角度看待俄罗斯会给人更多的启迪。凯南在进入外交界后在德国柏林大学主修俄国语言文学和历史，长期担任美国驻苏大使馆的工作人员，对苏联有着理性、感性和实践性的认识。笔者认为，凯南的“洞察力和预见力”正是源自于他对苏联社会和苏联历史文化的深刻认识。<br><br>

政治思想家们很早就注意到各种政治现象背后的文化因素。“在一定的历史时期，特定的政治体系中政治制度和社会成员的行为模式都带有自己的特点。这些特点不仅仅取决于社会的经济 发展水平以及社会的经济、政治结构，还受到该体系内社会的风俗、习惯、价值取向和思维方式等文化因素的影响。”[7]在阅读凯南的这两篇文章时，不难发现凯南就是透过政治现象背后的文化因素来分析苏联的现实政治的，他特别注重从苏联的民族性格、苏联外交的行为方式来判断苏联的政局走向。在凯南看来，影响苏联思维最深刻的是苏联的传统思维，而非意识形态。<br><br>

三 凯南眼中的苏联的民族性格特征<br><br>

1． 俄罗斯( 苏联) 人爱抄近路，希望能在最短的时间内达到效果。<br><br>

苏联解体后叶利钦实施的激进的休克疗法就 是俄罗斯的这种思维的活的表现。斯大林时期急速的集体化，强调发展重工业，忽视轻工业也是俄罗斯爱抄近路的表现。汉斯・摩根索认为，工业生产力是提升国家实力的重要因素。他评价道:“尽管苏联始终是一个潜在的强国，但直到 20 世纪 30 年代它进入最重要的工业国家行列之后，才真正成为一个强国。”[8]所以，可见，当时苏联强调重工业的发展就是为了抄近路而导致国家经济发展的不平衡。<br><br>

2． 俄罗斯( 苏联) 人富有激情和革命热情。<br><br>

在与俄罗斯人打交道时，我们往往能感受到俄罗斯的热情。十月革命的迅速成功也是俄罗斯 富有革命激情的体现。俄罗斯最富有激情的是“狄奥尼索斯”精神。这种酒神精神是一种狂欢化。凯南认为，马克思主义学说同俄罗斯“自己的内心冲动和激情是意气相投的。”[8]但俄罗斯往往是激情有余而理性不足。所以凯南评价当时的苏联是破坏能力有余而建设能力不够。“这些人的注意力多集中于必须推翻敌对政权而不大集中于社会建设……他们认为推翻敌对政权应优先于进行社会主义。因此，一旦掌权，他们对行将付诸实施的建设性计划的想法大多是模糊不清、流于空想和不切实际的。除了推行工业国有化和剥夺大宗私人占有的资本外，并无一致的计划。”[9]
<br><br>
3． 俄罗斯( 苏联) 人的不安全感强。<br><br>

这种不安全感导致他们猜疑心重，不会求得妥协，缺乏折中，很难与他人分享权利。小心上当。俄罗斯人的不安全感是由地缘因素和政治管理因素等造成的。从地缘因素来分析，“他们出生于俄罗斯―亚细亚世界”[10]，是“一个和平地生活在广袤而无法设防的平原上的农作居民与一群凶暴的游牧民为邻的结果”[11]。从政治管理角度来分析，凯南认为，俄国的管理方式落后、无序，惧怕来自外部的渗透。俄国的“统治是一种形式上相对无序的统治，其心理基础脆弱，而且虚假，无 法与西方国家的政治制度相提并论。”[12]缺乏“盎格鲁 － 撒克逊式调和折中传统的陶冶”[13]。所以苏联采取的方式是: 置对手于死地，不会求得妥协; 俄罗斯有一句俗语是“铁棍横扫，无招可挡，若要抵挡，铁棍加粗”。很难与他人分享权力; 封闭式的管理。<br><br>

封闭式管理也是造成上述特征的一个重要原因，表现为以下四点:<br><br>

第一，用意识形态的宣传机器将外部世界描绘成一个罪恶的世界，而将自己的世界描绘成一个美好的世界。
<br><br>
“苏联领导人迫于历史和现状的实际需要，就提出了一种教条，把外部世界描绘成为一个罪恶的、敌视的、威胁着苏联的世界，并认为这个世界内部滋生着、蔓延着疾病的细菌，注定要被越来越多的内部骚乱所破坏，最后难逃蒸蒸日上的社会主义力量的致命一击，从而让位给一个新的更美好的世界。”[14]<br><br>

第二，不能正确地理解外部世界。凯南怀疑，“这个国家到底有谁能够获得对外部世界准确而不偏见的信息”[15]。“我就怀疑斯大林本人能否得到客观地反映外部世界的信息。”[16]由于封闭式管理和意识形态的禁锢，在凯南看来，苏联的政策并非根据国内外形势作客观分析，而只是出于战前就存在的，今后仍存在的内部的本质需要。<br><br>

第三，将外部世界与内部世界隔离。“意识形态教育他们: 外部世界是敌视他们的，最终推翻他们国境以外的政治势力乃是他们的职责。”“用全世界都是他的敌人这个论点来证明自己的正确。”“国内追求无限的权力，同时制造外国持无情的敌对态度的半神话”来将外部世界与内部世界隔离。<br><br>

第四，扩充警察与军事力量。凯南认为，“苏联的政权是一个无与伦比的警察政权，由于沙皇时代的半明半暗的专制阴谋传统，他们已经习惯了将使用警察力量放在首要考虑的位置。”<br><br>

1924 年，斯大林曾专门为保持镇压机构进行辩护。其根据就是“只要资本主义的 包围还存在，就有进行干涉的危险以及由这种危险带来的后果。”所以苏联要扩军备战。凯南认为，这种行为从本质上看，“只是躁动不安的俄罗斯民族主义运动的稳步前进，而在这个流延了数个世纪的运动中，进攻与防御的理念一直是不可救药地混为一谈。”<br><br>

4． 俄罗斯( 苏联) 人的非黑即白思维。<br><br>

非黑即白表现为二元对立。资本主义与社会主义的对立，国内反对势力肯定是外国反动势力的代理人。以暴力的方式寻求正义和解决问题，而非妥协和协调。凯南认为，这些对立并非是以现实为依据的。资本主义与社会主义并不是对立 的。他认为，“今天的资本主义世界完全能够保持自身的和平，也能够与苏联和平相处。”[22]这种人为的对立是由“苏联的哲学和策略激起的”[23]，而非以现实为依据。
<br><br>
5． 俄罗斯( 苏联) 人的专制。<br><br>

凯南评价道: “他们很难面对与他人分享权力的局面。”[24]表现为上层是克里姆林宫一贯正确; 下层是服从迎合，对领导人的绝对忠诚。用暴政解决了服从的问题。“苏联的政权观不允许在党本身以外有任何组织核心，这就要求党的领导在理论上始终是真理的唯一宝库。”“共产党的铁的纪律就是以一贯正确这个原则为基础。” [25]“真理只是那些据说具有无限智慧的人新近表现出来的聪明才智，因为他们代表着历史的逻辑。”[26]“没有人向他们的权威地位提出挑战。即使有人这样做了，也会遭到这个国家镇压机器的压制。”[27]“大部分党员只受过铁的纪律和服从的训练，不谙妥协和通融的艺术”[28]。此外，在凯南的文章中我们还可以阅读到苏联人的容易轻信、相信未来和以救世主自居等民族性格。<br><br>

四 凯南眼中的苏联外交的行为方式<br><br>

凯南认为，苏联外交的行为方式表现为如下特征:<br><br>

1． 苏联外交行为的灵活性、现实性和弹性凯南对苏联外交行为作了非常详尽的描述。 如“守口如瓶、不够坦率、口是心非、战争猜疑、心怀叵测”[29]，“谨慎、周密、灵活、欺骗等被视为可贵的品质”[30]。当俄国人有求于人时，他就会做些退让，但本质性的东西不会发生改变。苏联外交如在“优势兵力前退却一举，抱着满不在乎的态度”。它是按照既定的目标前进。一旦出现阻力，它便采取逆来顺受的态度来适应形势，朝着理想的目标不断施压。所以凯南认为，苏联外交与拿破仑、希特勒外交比起来，“既容易，又难以对付”。它很现实。与对方力量相差悬殊，对方过于强大时，它容易放弃个别目标，重 视实力。但它也不会由于个别挫折而丧失信心。它对联合国的态度主要也是源自于实际的和策略上的考虑。<br><br>

苏联外交的弹性表现为“对理性的分析无动于衷，对逻辑的力量又是高度敏感。基于这个理由，当任何时候出现抵抗时，它是可能退却的。”
<br><br>
2． 苏联的扩张性苏联的扩张性表现为对苏联友善的国家，苏联要求其允许苏联在当地开放港口和建立基地。苏联是一个讲究海权的国家。并且这些行为只有在非政府的平台准备完成之后才会以政府的名义来推行。苏联会竭尽全力与所有可能倾向于反对西方的国家发展正式关系，并且注重自己的势力 范围。凯南推测，苏联的对外贸易有可能仅限于苏联自己的安全区内。
<br><br>
3． 苏联人注重声誉，善于利用对手的缺点; 注重礼仪，只作口头上的承诺。凯南认为，苏联领导人是鉴定人类心理的里手。他们很善于把握他人的心理。并且他们很看重声誉，绝非置声誉于不顾。他们既敌视西方又愿意与西方和平共处。他们很注重礼仪，强调苏联的权威和代表性，也非常注重细节。并且只作口头上的承诺，而口头上的承诺在实践中有可能被取消。他们对于涉及自我利益，尤其是经济利益时，会表现出缄默，会等待下去。<br><br>

五 凯南对苏联的预言<br><br>

1． 有关苏共的预言40 年代凯南就预言到: “要是发生什么破坏党这一政治工具的团结和效力的事件，那么，苏联便可能在一夜之间由最强变成最弱和最可怜的国家社会之一。”80 年代中后期苏联进行了新思维的改革，其中取消了宪法第六条，即保持苏共的领导。不久苏联就解体了。苏联共产党是一条红线，苏共一解散，这个国家就变得脆弱无比。这可能是对苏联解体的最早的预言。可见，凯南对苏联社会和苏联文化的了解是非常深刻的。<br><br>

2． 对苏联经济发展的预言凯南预言，“俄国在经济上就将始终是个脆弱的、而且从某种现实意义上说还是软弱无能的国家，它可以输出它的热情并散发出它那粗狂的政治活力所特有的奇异魅力，却不能以实际力量和繁荣景象来支持那些出口商品。”[35]苏联力图在短期内成为世界工业大国之一，但交通运输网络仍很落后。没有像样的公路网，只有相对原始的铁路网。生产力很低下，靠的是一种原始的韧性和力量，而缺乏西方的生产素养和工艺。<br><br>

3． 对苏联政权可持续性的预言凯南认为，苏联政权的更替是一个难以预测的问题。从列宁到斯大林的权力过渡就花了 12年的时间，牺牲了几百万人的生命。关于苏联共产党的问题。全党代表大会理论上是党的最高机 构，原定至少每三年召开一次，但这次过了将近 8个年头。权力机构的老化，党员之间的分歧比较大。所以凯南预言，“苏维埃运动的内部健康和长久并不可以看作是一个确定的事实。”[36]
<br><br>
六 凯南建议美国采取的应对措施<br><br>

1． 对苏联凯南明确地将苏联定位为对手，而不是伙伴。但苏美之间要避免发生大型战争，建议采取“遏制政策”，坚决警惕地遏制俄国的对外扩张的倾向。对俄国的政策提出要求时，“应采取留有商榷余地的方式，以避免过分损害俄国的声誉。”[37]在与苏联人打交道时，要以无可争辩的有效事实为后盾，话要说得动听，就会受到重视。要对苏联进行西方式的宣传，将希望寄托在苏联的新的一代人身上。
<br><br>
2． 对自身凯南认为，要认清共产主义运动的实质，并承认其客观存在。教育公众了解苏联问题的真相，不仅要靠媒体，更要靠政府。自身的社会要健康和有活力，要提高自身的士气、集体精神、自信心和纪律性。
<br><br>
3． 对西方盟友凯南认为欧洲已经疲惫不堪。欧洲需要的是领导，而不是责任。后来他参与了马歇尔援助计划的制订。通过马歇尔援助计划，美国用金钱资助了欧洲的经济复苏，阻挡了共产主义在欧洲的传播。<br><br>
<a href= "link05.html">中国对非洲拉美还几乎一无所知</a><br><br>
<a href= "link07.html">少看电视多看书</a><br><br>

七 结束语<br><br>

在分析凯南的文章的过程中，感觉已进入了 一个时间轨道，在聆听一位在苏联生活过若干年的美国外交官丝丝入扣地解析苏联的社会、政治和文化。虽然他当时写作的目的是为美国的外交政策服务的，带有意识形态的特征。但时隔半个多世纪，苏共灭亡，苏联解体，他的预言很多得到了印证。我们不得不佩服这位孤独的智者，因为这份长电报和他的“X”文章以及他提出的遏制政策而被载入史册，尽管他用大半生的时间批评美国的对苏政策，但他对苏联政治现象的透视，对美国对外政策的建议，不是基于表面的政治外交现象或事件，而是透过对对方的历史和文化的深刻研究而提出的远见卓识。这也是我们从事政治外交研究的学者，或具体从事上述工作的实践者特别值得体会和学习的。

摘要: 1953 年苏联 “贝利亚（Beria）事件”轰动一时。贝利亚到底是如何死的，至今仍是个谜。种种迹象表明，贝利亚并非经审判合法地被处决，而是 6 月 26 日在其住所被枪杀的。这是一场由赫鲁晓夫策动的有预谋的政变。为除去贝利亚，赫鲁晓夫在领导成员之间挑拨离间，动用了军队力量，甚至出动了坦克，搞突然袭击。赫鲁晓夫后来实施的改革，与贝利亚的 “百日新政”并无原则区别，说明这一事件不是由于政策路线的分歧，而是一场争权斗争，它为赫鲁晓夫飞黄腾达扫除了最大的障碍。
 <br><br>
贝利亚（1899年3月29日－1953年12月23日），格鲁吉亚人，苏共高级领导人，长期担任内务人民委员部（秘密警察）首脑。是斯大林大清洗计划的主要执行者之一，第二次世界大战结束后被斯大林晋升为军事元帅。雅尔塔会议中斯大林曾向罗斯福介绍说：“他是我们的希姆莱。”[1]在斯大林逝世之前，他是苏联的极重要权力人物，斯大林逝世之后，在斗争中失败，被撤职并秘密处决。
<br><br>
Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria was a Soviet politician, Marshal of the Soviet Union and state security administrator, chief of the Soviet security and secret police apparatus (NKVD) under Joseph Stalin during World War II, and Deputy Premier in the postwar years (1946C53).<br><br>

1953 年斯大林逝世后不久，苏联破获了 “贝利亚叛国案”，贝利亚于 12 月经审判被枪决。此案震惊世界，也在中国引起强烈反响。然而多年之后，此案的诸多疑团逐渐显露，种种迹象表明，这实际上是由赫鲁晓夫策动的一场政变。<br><br>

1938 年 8 月，时任格鲁吉亚共产党第一书记的贝利亚被调到莫斯科工作，任内务人民委员部第一副委员，同年 12 月升任内务人民委员。1945 年 8 月至 1953 年 6 月任苏联部长会议国防委员会第一专门委员会主席。1950 年 4 月至 1953 年 3 月任部长会议主席团常务委员会委员。斯大林逝世后，贝利亚任部长会议第一副主席兼内务部长，位置仅次于马林科夫，排第二位。那时赫鲁晓夫任中央书记处书记，没有政府职务，排第五位。赫鲁晓夫是从莫斯科市委书记的位置提上来的，此前还担任过乌克兰共产党第一书记。这两个职务都算不上是全国性的，只能算是地方领导人，而马林科夫和贝利亚则都是全国性领导人。特别是贝利亚，可以说是当时苏共中央里最能干的领导人，并且有安全系统的支持，凭赫鲁晓夫的位置和实力是无法同他相对抗的，只有采取非常手段才能排除自己上升道路上的这一最大障碍。自斯大林逝世后，在赫鲁晓夫的仕途中共经历过三次政变: 第一次就是剪除贝利亚; 第二次是1957 年马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫等发动政变，企图推翻赫鲁晓夫，但弄巧成拙，反而被赫鲁晓夫打成了 “反党集团”;第三次是 1964 年勃列日涅夫、苏斯洛夫、谢列平等发动政变，终于把赫鲁晓夫赶下了台。在苏联历史上，一个领导人亲历三次政变实属罕见，而其中最惊心动魄的一次当数剪除贝利亚。这是一场流血的政变。<br><br>

苏联官方对 “贝利亚事件”的说法<br><br>

按照苏联官方的说法，贝利亚案的经过大体如下: 1953 年 3 月 5 日斯大林逝世，在他弥留之际，苏共中央主席团开会，组成了新的苏联党政领导班子。会上，贝利亚提名 马林科夫担任部长会议主席，马林科夫提议贝利亚担任部长会议第一副主席兼内务部长。斯大林逝世后，贝利亚开始了他的 “百日新政”，采取了一系列措施改变现行的国内外政策。6 月26 日，克里姆林宫召开会议，在会上逮捕了贝利亚。7 月2―7 日，苏共中央召开全会，揭发批判贝利亚。7 月 10 日，《真理报》公开报道了贝利亚事件。12 月23 日，对贝利亚及其同案犯六人宣判死刑并立即执行。<br><br>

上述说法存在好多疑点。让我们从此案的结局开始，倒过来逐一进行考察。当时在克里姆林宫从事保卫工作的希日尼亚克・古尔维奇少校，曾奉命看管被捕的贝利亚，并亲自参加了对贝利亚死刑的执行。据他回忆: 6 月 26 日，他和另外 50 名卫兵被召集在一起执行一项特殊任务，他们等候在克里姆林宫正门外面。当夜，古尔维奇和他的同事押送贝利亚前往秘密关押地点――莫斯科市中心奥斯班考大街的一所地下室。关押贝利亚的房间只有 20 平方米，四周没有窗户。在以后等待审判的六个月中，古尔维奇一直住在贝利亚房间的隔壁，全权负责料理贝利亚的生活。在关押期间，贝利亚说得最多的就是: “我是无辜的，很快就会被放出去，等我出去以后，要好好地报答你。”1953 年 11 月以后，对贝利亚的审判正式开始，古尔维奇每天陪他上法庭。贝利亚的死刑判决下来后，古尔维奇给他买了一套黑色西服，供他在行刑时穿。行刑当天，古尔维奇给贝利亚戴好手铐，送他到地下室的另外一个房间，那里有五名军官等着他。贝利亚知道自己将被处死，他叮嘱古尔维奇把他死去的消息通知他的儿子。几分钟后，苏联空军参谋长巴茨斯基中将在近距离内向贝利亚开了第一枪，然后命令其他行刑队员开枪。古尔维奇也掏出了手枪，在距离贝利亚两米远的地方开枪射击。行刑完毕，其他军官迅速离开了，留下古尔维奇一个人处理后事。他用帆布裹起贝利亚的尸体，送到火葬 场。在那里，古尔维奇把贝利亚的尸体推进了焚化炉，最后又用巨大的鼓风机把他的骨灰吹得一干二净[1]。<br><br>

然而，关于贝利亚死亡情况的官方资料存在许多疑点: (1) 案卷中没有留下贝利亚的手印，而摁手印是必须的手续; (2) 案卷中没有贝利亚的最新照片，按规定，囚犯入狱后必须有正面和侧面照片，而贝利亚的案卷中只有一张较为年轻的、不戴夹鼻眼镜的正面照片，看上去比当时 54 岁的贝利亚要年轻 10 岁左右，显然不是入狱时拍的; (3)审讯记录中没有贝利亚的签字; (4) 案卷中没有判决书的原件，无论判决书还是审讯记 录都没有法官的签字，只有科涅夫元帅一人的签字; (5) 案卷中没有枪决后确认贝利亚死亡的医生签名，而同案其他六名被枪决者均有医生的签名; (6) 其他六名被枪决者的遗体均留有火化的相关文件，而贝利亚的则没有。这就使人不得不怀疑贝利亚是否真的在 12 月 23 日被枪毙了，因为这些手续按常规是应该有的，经办者是决不会疏忽的。此外，贝利亚于 6 月26 日被捕，直到7 月8 日才公布逮捕贝利亚的决定，这种做法在苏联历史上也是前所未见的。贝利亚的 “审讯记录”所标的日期为 7 月 23 日至 8 月 26 日，这就是说，贝利亚很有可能在审讯结束后立即就被执行枪决了，所以在所谓正式审判和执行枪决时，已经不存在活着的贝利亚了，也就无法形成所需要的文件了。<br><br>

贝利亚被捕后，7 月 2―7 日苏共中央召开中央全会，揭发批判贝利亚的罪行。这时候贝利亚还没有被开除出苏共中央主席团、苏共中央和苏共，按理他有权出席全会，为自己辩护，但实际上他没有在全会露面，被剥夺了这一权利。据说，会上宣读了贝利亚给马林科夫、赫鲁晓夫等人的三封信，这也许能够证明贝利亚还活着。然而有专家认为，这三封信不是贝利亚的笔迹和签名: 头两封信是用正规的书法写的，用这种写法通常都是不愿让对方认出自己的笔迹; 第三封信写得比较匆忙，也不像是贝利亚的笔迹。拿这三封信同贝利亚以前在文件上的批语和签名对照，可以清楚地看出不是同一个人的笔迹。因此有研究者认为，这三封信是伪造的，不足以证明贝利亚当时还活着，还呆在莫斯科军区司令部的地下室[2]。全会上一些人发言的用语，似乎也表明贝利亚已被消灭。例如，卡冈诺维奇在会上说 “中央委员会消灭了冒险分子贝利亚”，“现在，当我们了结了阻碍我们前进的奸细贝利亚”[3]。赫鲁晓夫在会上谈到贝利亚时，用的也都是过去式。
<br><br>
这就有必要再往前回溯到 1953 年 6 月 26 日，这一天到底发生了什么? 官方的说法是，这一天在克里姆林宫召开了会议。到底是什么会议? 说得并不清楚: 一种说法是部长会议; 另一种说法是苏共中央主席团会议; 第三种说法是，先是部长会议，然后改为主席团会议，以便让非政府成员的主席团委员能够合法参加会议。赫鲁晓夫的说法是部长会议主席团会议，同时邀请了苏共中央主席团全体成员参加，但马林科夫主持会议时把它说成是苏共中央主席团会议，这样就可以讨论党内问题了。<br><br>

接下来，在这次会上发生了什么事? 官方的说法是，会上逮捕了贝利亚。怎么逮捕的? 存在不同的说法: 一种说法是马林科夫或者他的助手发出了暗号; 另一种说法是马林科夫紧张得找不到桌子下面的电铃，赫鲁晓夫动手揿了电铃，发出信号，闻讯进来了几个将军。是谁逮捕了贝利亚? 朱可夫说，是他拧住了贝利亚的双手; 莫斯卡连柯说，是他迫使贝利亚举起双手; 巴季茨基说是他抱住了贝利亚; 而赫鲁晓夫说，逮捕时贝利亚把手伸向了公文包，他怕贝利亚去拿枪，就急忙摁住了他的手。就这么一个逮捕贝利亚的过程，当事人竟有几种不同的说法。细节的不同说明有人说的不是实话。这使人们不由地产生一个疑问: 究竟有没有在会议上逮捕贝利亚这回事?<br><br>

如果事情不是发生在克里姆林宫的会议上，那么，逮捕或枪杀贝利亚的事到底发生在什么地方呢? 一个说法是，那一天领导们在大剧院观看歌剧 《十二月党人》，贝利亚在回家的路上被逮捕。另一个说法是，那一天领导们出席波兰使馆的招待会，回家时贝利亚和伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁同乘一辆车，途中被后两人制服并逮捕。由于这两种说法都缺乏旁证，现在已经很少有人提及。第三种说法是，26 日贝利亚在自己家里的办公室被击毙。关于一位国家二号人物的被捕或死亡，竟存在这么多的不同说法，而且都出自当事人之口，且离事发时间并不远，这就说明里面肯定有问题，肯定有人要对公众、对 历史隐瞒什么。<br><br>

到现在为止，我们用倒叙的方法一项项地来排除官方的说法: 贝利亚不是在 12 月23 日被枪毙的，在七月中央全会期间贝利亚已经不在人世了，6 月 26 日在克里姆林宫会议上逮捕贝利亚一事不可信。下面我们来看看比较可信的另一种说法，即贝利亚的儿子谢尔戈・贝利亚的说法: 贝利亚是在他住所的办公室里被枪杀的。<br><br>
<a href= "pic02.html">美国控制域名解析系统</a><br><br>

谢尔戈・贝利亚的说法<br><br>

贝利亚的儿子谢尔戈在 《我的父亲贝利亚》一书中提出了完全不同的说法: “无论是 12 月，还是 11 月、10 月、9 月和 7 月，我父亲拉夫连季・巴甫洛维奇・贝利亚都不 能够给正在奔向权力巅峰的赫鲁晓夫同志写 ‘忏悔信’，也不能提供有关证词，因为他已经于 1953 年 6 月 26 日在莫斯科市被杀害了，既无审判，也没有调查。”[4]如果此说成立，那么上面提到的种种疑问就都可以得到合理的解释了。
<br><br>
我们引谢尔戈・贝利亚另一段较为详细的回忆:<br><br>

1953 年 6 月 26 日，父亲在官邸。我走得早一些，大约 8 点钟，一小时后已到克里姆林宫 (父亲的办公室在对面大楼) 。下午 4 点钟，我们要向父亲报告实施核爆炸的准备情况。……约 12 点钟，万尼科夫秘书处的一位工作人员来我这里，让我接电话，是 两次荣获苏联英雄称号的我们的飞机试飞员阿梅特・汗来的电话。他对着话筒喊道:“谢尔戈，我告诉你一个可怕的消息，不过你要坚持住! 你们的房子被军人包围了，你的父亲非常可能已被打死。我已经要了一辆汽车在克里姆林宫的大门口，你坐上去机场。趁为时未晚，我打算把你拉到别的什么地方去! ”我开始往父亲的秘书处打电话。电话没有声音，大概他们把它掐断了。官邸和住宅也没有人接电话，所有联系都断了。……于是我给万尼科夫 (时任装备部部长) 去电话。听到我说的，他也去打电话，用的是自己的专线。这一天，根据父亲的建议，决定召开中央主席团扩大会议。……万尼科夫查明，会议被取消了，出了什么莫名其妙的事。……怕我一人被抓走，鲍里斯・利沃维奇 (万科维奇) 同我一起去了市内位于花园环路的官邸。这一地区实际上已经被军人封锁，在万尼科夫再次给赫鲁晓夫打电话之前，久久不让我们进入院子。最后，得到他(赫鲁晓夫) 的准许，让我们进去了，这也证明他参与了所发生的事情。我父亲房间的那面墙被大口径机枪的子弹打出好多弹坑，窗子被打碎，门被打掉。我正绝望地看着这一切，一位警卫跑来对我说: “谢尔戈，刚刚从房子里用担架抬出一个人，上面盖着粗帆布。”[5]
<br><br>
谢尔戈的说法得到苏联医学科学院院士彼得・尼古拉耶维奇・布尔加索夫少将回忆录的证实。布尔加索夫从1950 年起在一个秘密小组工作，研制防护细菌、化学和核武器的材料。他写道:<br><br>

(6 月 26 日) 12 点 30 分，我从小卖部回楼上自己的办公室。突然，苏联装备部部长鲍里斯・利沃维奇・万尼科夫和贝利亚的儿子谢尔戈像一朵乌云从我身旁飞过，他们几乎把我撞倒。万尼科夫没有停下来，沿着楼梯奔跑，这是罕见的事。贝利亚的儿子白天也从来没有在我们这里出现过。我同鲍里斯・利沃维奇的关系非常好，我想知道出了什么事，就去了他的办公室。他坐着，脑袋耷拉在桌子上，然后抬起头来对我说: “我们的头儿，拉夫连季・巴甫洛维奇・贝利亚没了。今天他在莫斯科自己的住所被枪杀了。我到那里去过。”他还说，一位军人给贝利亚的儿子去电话说，他父亲的房子被士兵包围了。万尼科夫和谢尔戈立即驱车去了那里。贝利亚房子周围停着军车，院子里有冲锋枪手走动。一位上尉告诉万尼科夫，15 分钟前从房子里抬出一副有死人的担架，用篷布盖着。贝利亚办公室的玻璃被自动步枪击碎。这就是万尼科夫对我说的。而你们知道，在 1953 年 6 月 26 日那一天，没有召开任何中央全会，没有召开逮捕贝利亚的会议，就像后来所写的那样。斯帕斯基大门、克里姆林宫入口、我们的房子和拉夫连季・巴甫洛维奇 (贝利亚) 的办公室等处，警卫也没有更换。站岗的还是原先那些哨兵，我对他们很熟悉。……就在那一天，6 月 26 日，我突然被调到总参谋部的另一个分部。这救了我，因为后来开始了告密、安全机关传讯。我也被传讯，但没有事，而我的所有同事都遭到镇压，万尼科夫的遭遇不明。<br><br>

……至于所谓逮捕拉夫连季・巴甫洛维奇，实际上他在1953 年6 月已被野蛮地杀害于其住所。作为事件的目击者，我要说明如下: 一天的下午 3 点钟，谢尔戈・贝利亚来到分部，他走进万尼科夫办公室，又迅速与鲍里斯・利沃维奇离开办公室。午餐休息(从 5 点至 7 点) 后我去见鲍里斯・利沃维奇，打听不寻常的情况。他显得忧郁，久久看着我，然后慢慢地、几乎像耳语那样告诉我，发生了极大的不幸: 拉夫连季・巴甫洛维奇在自己家的办公室里被直接枪杀了。鲍里斯・利沃维奇告诉我，在告知谢尔戈关于发生不幸的消息之后，他同谢一起乘车去了尼基塔路上的官邸。住宅的围墙外停了许多军车，院内有军人走动。其中一人对来人说，半小时前从房子里用担架抬出一个人，身体用篷布盖着。拉夫连季・巴甫洛维奇办公室的玻璃被打碎。这就是真实的历史[6]。<br><br>

俄罗斯 《星期》周刊在 1997 年第 22 期刊载了 C・戈利亚伊诺夫 (民间应用研究中心主任) 记录的科学技术博士 A・韦杰宁的见证。韦杰宁1952―1953 年在莫斯科郊区内务部特种分队训练班学习，他的说法如下:<br><br>

我们开始收到关于贝利亚及其亲信的情报资料，这些专案资料是克鲁格洛夫的人送来的。克鲁格洛夫是贝利亚的第一副手。我们知道他 (送资料者) 的名字是尼古拉・科罗特科。……曾制定了几个消灭 (贝利亚) 的方案。6 月 26 日早上 6 点左右，我们得到通知，将在今天行动。起初打算采取 “车祸”的方案，快 8 点钟的时候来了实施 “官邸”方案的命令。快 10 点钟，我们分乘 3 辆 “胜利牌”卡车到达卡恰洛夫大街 28 号的贝利亚官邸。小分队由科罗特科领导。克鲁格洛夫通过高频电话与贝利亚通话，说科罗特科要带 3 名警卫送机密文件。这时我们已经得知，官邸内除贝利亚本人外，还有 4 个人。科罗特科和我们中的 3 名 “随从”顺利地进了大楼，其他人根据预定行动方案分别抢占了大楼正面和院内规定的位置。两三分钟后传来一阵枪声――我听见 5 声，也可能是 6 声。我当时紧挨贝利亚办公室的一扇朝向院子的窗户，从办公室射出的两发子弹打 碎了靠楼拐角处第二扇窗户的玻璃。几分钟后，科罗特科从楼内走出来，命令我们都进楼去。有 3 人被击毙: 两个警卫和贝利亚本人。我们无一伤亡，显然这是精心准备和突然行动的结果。……科罗特科把贝利亚家中的所有文件统统运走，我们则回到莫斯科郊区的基地。贝利亚档案以后的情况如何，我不知道，不过我想克鲁格洛夫以后的遭遇都同这些文件有关[7]。
<br><br>
这就是说，击毙贝利亚的是其副手谢尔盖・克鲁格洛夫，地点就在贝利亚官邸的办公室。这个说法同谢尔戈、布尔加索夫的说法是一致的。
<br><br>
斯大林去世后，克鲁格洛夫被任命为改组后的内务部副部长，他组建并领导了特种 分队 (第 11 分队) ，枪杀贝利亚的就是这支部队。克鲁格洛夫负责特别警卫工作，不仅能够接触所有严密警卫的对象，而且负责组建其警卫队，每个警卫对象身边至少有一个直接听命于他的 “密派小厮”。除去贝利亚之后，克鲁格洛夫立即担任了内务部长。也许因为在贝利亚事件中有功，他是贝利亚同事中唯一一个没有被清洗的高官。但是这样一个人掌握安全部门对赫鲁晓夫来说是不安全的。1956 年 1 月，克鲁格洛夫被调任电站建设部副部长，1958 年 7 月退休。然而他过得并不安宁，1959 年被取消了将军级养老金，搬出了权贵的住宅，次年因 “参与政治镇压”被开除出党。1977 年他被火车轧死。他的这段经历似乎也能说明一些什么。<br><br>

至于那些被招到克里姆林宫开会的将军们，如莫斯卡连柯、朱可夫、巴格里茨基等，究竟去了枪杀贝利亚的现场没有? 没有任何材料提到。不过可以设想，将军们在参加会议之前去了贝利亚官邸的现场。像枪杀贝利亚这样的大事，仅仅让一个内务部副部长去执行显然是不够的，需要国防部和莫斯科军区的将领们去坐镇，这就显得合理一些了。贝利亚事件的研究者穆欣 (《钢铁的人民委员》一书的作者) 和彼得堡著名女记者普鲁德尼科娃 (《贝利亚，他没有罪》一书的作者) 都认为: 26 日，巴格里茨基将军和莫斯科军区司令莫斯卡连柯在贝利亚的住所逮捕他时将其击毙，完成任务后他们去克里姆林宫出席主席团会议，一方面汇报解决贝利亚的情况，另一方面也可以对会上持不同意见的主席团委员施加压力。穆欣还提出了一个间接证明: “我给最后一位还活着的、当时的中央委员 Н・К・巴依巴科夫去电话。在谈论技术问题的过程中，我问他是否还记得 1953 年的七月中央全会。当尼古拉・康斯坦丁诺维奇回想的时候 (他已 90 岁) ，我突然问他: ‘您在全会上是否知道贝利亚已经被打死?’他迅速回答说: ‘不，我那时什么也不知道。’不过，停顿一下之后，他接着说: ‘不过事实是，他已经被打死了’”。<br><br>

关于替身之说
<br><br>
如果说贝利亚在6 月26 日已经被枪杀，那么在此之后出现的所谓贝利亚到底是什么人呢? 有一个说法，被关押和枪毙的不是贝利亚本人，而是他的替身，根据是: (1) 审判庭成员、苏共中央主席团委员什维尔尼克曾对贝利亚的儿子说: 他一次也没有见到过活的贝利亚。另一位审判庭成员、苏共中央书记米哈伊尔也对他说: 坐着的完全是另一个人。其实这两人同贝利亚是很熟的，不会辨认不清。其他主席团委员都没有亲临审判现场，而是在办公室听现场转播。(2) 贝利亚被关进莫斯科军区的地下室后，经常戴一顶一直压到耳朵的帽子，他进出的两旁楼上的窗户都被涂上红颜色，为的是不让楼上的人看到。(3) 贝利亚案的其他案犯都关押在内务部的监狱，唯独贝利亚关押在莫斯科军区司令部的地下室，这种做法违背常理。据说，把贝利亚关押在普通监狱不安全，他的党徒会帮他逃脱，但为什么其他被捕的内务部高官没有这种危险呢? (4) 6 月 27 日上午，贝利亚的两位副手――克鲁格洛夫和谢罗夫――曾来到禁闭室，要求见自己的领导，但莫斯卡连柯不放他们进去。问题很简单，如果被关押的是替身的话，那马上会被 揭穿! (5) 负责看管贝利亚的希日尼亚克・古尔维奇少校曾写有回忆文章，记叙关押中的贝利亚的表现以及被枪决的过程。但此人原先并不认识贝利亚，他的见证并不能证实关押的就是贝利亚本人。(6) 逮捕贝利亚后的第一个措施是更换总检察长，把萨弗诺夫换成了听话的鲁坚科，这显然是为了便于此后的各种安排。因此，较为合理的解释是:被关押在司令部地下室的并不是贝利亚本人，而是其替身; 因为是替身，所以就不能让内务部以及其他部门那些熟悉贝利亚的人看到。
<br><br>
关于替身的出现，有两种说法。第一种说法是，一个装扮成贝利亚的替身在 6 月 26日 13 点左右被送到克里姆林宫，又在16 点30 分被送出克里姆林宫。在把假贝利亚运出去之前，其车上的警卫也被更换，这是为了防止警卫反抗，也为了消除使用替身的见证人。第二种说法是，替身很可能是在从莫斯科军区禁闭室转移到军区地下室过程中被换上的，贝利亚根本没有被押到专门的审判厅大楼，审判厅就设在了莫斯科军区司令部里，贝利亚的六个同案犯就是在这里接受审判的。使用替身在苏联政坛不是什么新鲜事，斯大林就曾有几个替身，真假难辨。如果说贝利亚被枪杀后使用了替身，那么后来出现的一系列难以理解的现象，也就可以得到合理的解释了。

一场有预谋的政变<br><br>

枪杀贝利亚不是一个突发的偶然事件，而是蓄谋已久的政变。对其准备过程，赫鲁晓夫在回忆录中有详细的记录。1953 年 3 月初，斯大林因脑溢血病倒，中央主席团委员轮流值班，看护不省人事的斯大林。赫鲁晓夫写道:<br><br>

一天傍晚，布尔加宁和我值夜。我对他说，斯大林的病是治不好了，你可知道斯大林死时我们将会处于什么地位? 你可知道贝利亚将会为自己攫取什么地位? 布问: 哪一个职位? 我答: 他想当国家安全部长。无论如何，我们不能让他当这个。如果他当了国家安全部长，那就是我们末日的开始。他是为了要毁灭我们才想谋取这个职位的。…… 布同意这一看法，于是我们就开始商量具体防范措施，决定由我去做马林科夫的工作。在斯大林弥留之际召开苏共中央主席团和主席团常务委员会会议之前，我找马林科夫谈“该怎么办”，但被马林科夫顶了回去，他说: “现在谈什么? 等大家一起来了，咱们再谈吧。所以我们要开一个会”[8]。<br><br>

就是在这次会上，贝利亚提议马林科夫担任苏共第一书记和部长会议主席，马林科夫提议贝利亚担任部长会议第一副主席，兼任改组后的内务部长。互相提名的事实说明，贝利亚同马林科夫有着良好的关系，要扳倒贝利亚必须首先离间这两人的关系。此后，经常出现如赫鲁晓夫所说的 “以贝利亚和马林科夫为一方，以主席团为另一方”之间的冲突。赫鲁晓夫继续做其他领导人的工作，争取他们来共同反对贝利亚。他首先说服了马林科夫，然后陆续串联莫洛托夫、卡冈诺维奇、萨布罗夫、别尔乌辛。在同伏罗希洛夫谈话时遇到了一点麻烦。伏罗希洛夫一张嘴就称赞起贝利亚，说他是个 “多么杰出的人啊! ”这就封住了赫鲁晓夫的嘴，最后只好让马林科夫做他的工作，把他争取了过来。最后只剩下米高扬不配合，“米高扬反对解除贝利亚的职务，他说，贝利亚是个很好的工作人员，等等”。但赫鲁晓夫这边已经构成了多数。
<br><br>
值得注意的是，在赫鲁晓夫同上述领导人谈话中，说的不是贝利亚到底有什么罪错，而是说这个人对他们的危险性。这就说明，赫鲁晓夫反贝利亚不是出于政见的不同，而是对贝利亚这个老牌安全官员的害怕和担心，需要除去自己飞黄腾达路上的障碍，因而在斯大林弥留之际，他就开始拉帮结派，暗算贝利亚了。他在回忆录中还承认: “40 年代后期，我已经深信，斯大林死后我们应该尽可能地阻止贝利亚在党内占据领导地位。否则，就是党的末日。”[9]赫鲁晓夫在回忆录中不断说贝利亚搞挑拨离间，实际上在斯大林逝世前后从事挑拨离间勾当的，正是赫鲁晓夫本人!<br><br>

卡冈诺维奇曾描绘过最后一次同贝利亚会见的情景: “(6 月 25 日) 告别时，他握了我的手，只有我听见，我也答以 ‘热烈的’握手: 好吧，坏蛋，最后一次握手，明天两点钟我们等着你。我们不是同你握手，而是逮住你的尾巴。”这就等于公开承认，在事变的前夜他们已做好了准备。<br><br>

关于逮捕或者杀害贝利亚的经过虽然众说纷纭，但有一点是肯定的，剪除贝利亚所使用的手段完全是政变的手段，动用了国防军的元帅将领，甚至出动了坦克。据赫鲁晓夫回忆录中的说法，鉴于保卫克里姆林宫的是内务部的卫队，所以决定取得军队的帮 助: “我们把拘留贝利亚的任务交托给防空司令莫斯卡连柯和五位将军。这是我出的主意。到了会议前夕，把朱可夫元帅和其他一些人也包括了进来。”这个说法得到莫斯卡连柯回忆文章的证实。莫斯卡连写道:<br><br>

(6 月 26 日) 上午 9 点钟，赫鲁晓夫通过克里姆林宫的自动电话交换机打电话找我，问候之后他问道: “您周围有没有同您关系密切，并且像您这样忠于党的人?”我想了想，回答说: “有这样一批人，他们绝对忠于党。”然后，赫鲁晓夫要我带这些人到克里姆林宫原先斯大林工作的办公室，找苏联部长会议主席格・马林科夫。他补了一句，要 我带上防空计划和雪茄。我回答说: “我带上所说的一切，但我早在战争期间，在 1944年就戒烟了。”赫鲁晓夫笑着说，需要的雪茄不是我所想的。到这时候我才想起要带上武器。最后他说，他立即给国防部长布尔加宁去电话。赫鲁晓夫关于要带武器的暗示使我想到，要执行苏共中央主席团的一项重要任务。<br><br>

……我按了一下电铃，召来执行特别任务的军官 B・尤费列夫少校、参谋长 A・巴克索夫少将、政治部主任 H・祖布上校，我告诉他们要到克里姆林宫去并带上武器。但他们手头都没有武器，所以我叫来参谋部警卫队长希日尼亚克少校，命令他分发给他们手枪和子弹。由于人数不多，我又打电话给内卫部队参谋长 (原防空军区参谋长) 巴季茨基，叫他带上武器到我这儿来。<br><br>

接着国防部长布尔加宁来电话，说赫鲁晓夫同志给他去了电话，建议我先去他 (布尔加宁) 那里。我带着武装好的几个人到了国防部长那里。布尔加宁单独接见了我。他说: “我接到赫鲁晓夫的电话，所以就召你来了。需要逮捕贝利亚，他在克里姆林宫的卫队人多势大，并且忠于他。你有几个人?”我回答说: “5 人，他们全都是久经战场的军人，绝对可靠，忠于共产党、苏联政府和人民。”他回答说: “这一切都很好，但人太少了。”随即问我: “你认为还可以找谁来? 但不能耽搁。”我说: “您的副手瓦西列夫斯基元帅。”不知为什么，他当即否定了这位人选。我问他: “在有影响的军人中，谁现在在部里。”他说: “格・康・朱可夫。”于是我建议让他来。他同意了，但要朱可夫不带武器。不过，我们人还是少，所以他问: “你认为还可以请谁参加?”我首先提议总政治部副主任勃列日涅夫，我在战时认识他，那时他在第一和第四乌克兰方面军，是位勇敢的将军，忠于党和人民的政治工作者。在战争中我多次见过他。我提的第二个人是沙季洛夫中将，也是总政治部副主任，前第一乌克兰方面军政治部主任。第三个是坦克军中将格特曼，原前线坦克军团司令。第四个是炮兵上将涅杰林，是我在战时认识的。第五个是布尔加宁建议邀请的，即莫斯科军区军事委员会成员 A・M・普罗宁上将[10]。<br><br>

为了实施政变，赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁调兵遣将是没有疑问的，问题只在于是把他们派到克里姆林宫呢，还是派到贝利亚官邸的办公室? 看样子，官方以及某些军官的回忆录没有说真话。<br><br>

6 月 26 日下午 14 点左右，坎特米洛夫师接到了出动坦克的命令，这是在主席团会议开始后 20 分钟左右，由国防部长布尔加宁下的命令。这时候主席团委员们大概已知 道了贝利亚被击毙的消息，所以某些人不同意把事情说成是逮捕贝利亚，于是在支持和反对赫鲁晓夫的人之间开始了斗争。15 点左右，莫斯科街头出现了坦克，坦克开往红场并把炮口对准克里姆林宫。这实际上是要对那些持反对意见的主席团委员施加压力。结果，苏共中央领导层达成了统一的口径: 人民的敌人贝利亚已被捕。这样就可以继续导演以后的一系列演出了。
<br><br>
军队将领们出席克里姆林宫会议，应是在击毙贝利亚之后。据谢尔戈说，贝利亚同朱可夫在战前和战争中关系一直很好。朱可夫的回忆录出版后，谢尔戈曾有机会同朱可夫当面谈话，他对谢尔戈说: “所有关于我参加逮捕贝利亚的说法都纯属臆造! ”从 1949年至斯大林逝世前，国防部长一直是瓦西列夫斯基。1953 年 3 月 5 日，布尔加宁被重新任命为国防部长 (他曾在 1947―1949 年担任过此职务) 。布尔加宁的副手是朱可夫，而朱可夫在军队中的威望大大高于布尔加宁。因此，需要召朱可夫参加主席团会议，用他的威望迫使委员们倒向赫鲁晓夫。朱可夫、莫斯卡连柯和巴季茨基之所以参加主席团会议，合理的解释只能是: 汇报击毙贝利亚的经过，同时也展示军队的支持。
<br><br>
这样，我们就大致可以描绘出 26 日事变的经过: 当天出动了两支武装部队，一支由元帅将军们率领直奔贝利亚住所，将贝利亚击毙; 一支坦克部队开往红场，威慑某些持异议的主席团委员。然而，一位国家二号人物就这样被杀死，对外是很难交代的，所以需要继续演戏，把事情说圆，这就有了后来的逮捕、审判、枪决、火化等剧情。<br><br>

政变者达到了自己的目的，剪除了贝利亚，但他们却倒打一耙，指控贝利亚企图发动政变、逮捕中央主席团委员。贝利亚有可能发动政变吗?<br><br>

说贝利亚企图发动政变是完全不能成立的。1953 年 6 月，贝利亚奉命赴东德，处理那里发生的工人骚乱事件，在德国呆了 10 天。6 月 25 日，刚从德国回来的贝利亚请求马林科夫在次日召集主席团会议，讨论前国家安全部长伊格纳季耶夫及其副手柳明的活动，以确定他们在捏造一系列案件中的个人责任，如 “明格列尔案件”、 “列宁格勒案件”等。一个准备发动政变的人，是不会在紧要关头到国外去的，他需要坐镇莫斯科指挥政变，并且苏联官方一直也没有拿出贝利亚搞政变的具体证据。6 月 25 日深夜，贝利亚同马林科夫曾有一番友好的长谈，然后贝利亚送马林科夫回格拉诺夫街的住所。据司机说，他们下车后又友好地谈了约 10 分钟。在政变――不管是推翻马林科夫的政变还 是剪除贝利亚的政变――前夕，这样友好的谈话是很难想象的!<br><br>

如果强力部门真的有政变的阴谋，那么苏共中央主席团委员们就不会在 27 日轻松地去剧院看歌剧 《十二月党人》了，他们应躲在可靠的安全地方。这也说明，那时根本没有任何危险，对手已经被剪除。7 月 2―7 日的中央全会是专门声讨贝利亚的，然而在会议记录上看到的对贝利亚的指控都是些小事，没有一项涉及 “政变阴谋”。可见，赫鲁晓夫的政变才是真的，而所谓贝利亚政变纯属捏造!

关于贝利亚的 “百日新政”<br><br>

贝利亚和马林科夫的关系本来就比较好。据赫鲁晓夫说: “斯大林一度把马林科夫调离中央委员会书记处，派他去中亚细亚。贝利亚向马林科夫伸出援手，为他调回莫斯科作了安排。从那时起，贝利亚同马林科夫就成了分不开的朋友。”[11]斯大林逝世后，他俩是真正主持工作的掌权人。 “马―贝组合”也许是一个比较理想的组合。马林科夫长期替斯大林管理党务和政府事务，但缺乏魄力，莫洛托夫对他的评价是: “马林科夫是个非常好的执行者，我们把他叫做 ‘守电话机的人’”; “马林科夫没有主见，意志薄弱”，“是个十分墨守成规的人，他可以照章办事，但依我看，他无力更深入地和具有批判性地分析研究经济问题和政治问题”[12]。而贝利亚精明能干，脑子灵活，从他主持原子弹和火箭研制并在短期内取得的重大成就来看，确实是个干才，莫洛托夫对他的评价是: “他很精明，只干那些对他有利的事。他甚至不是野心家”; “他是个有才能的人，不考虑那些微不足道的事，他干事很有把握”; “他讲俄语文理通顺，是个有组织能力的人，是个优秀的行政领导人。看来也是很有天赋的肃反人员，但是个毫无原则的人，给谁效劳都行”[13]。<br><br>

莫洛托夫同这两个人长期共事，他的评价大体是符合实际的。从后来主政的、出身于安全部门的领导人如安德罗波夫、普京来看，由于职业特点，这类人在一个相对封闭的国家里能够较多了解国内外的真实情况，不会被假象和虚假信息所蒙蔽，办事干练果断，知道使用什么手段达到自己的目的。<br><br>

贝利亚的才能在其一百多天的执政期间得到充分体现。在这段时间里，他对内外政策所作的修正，为赫鲁晓夫后来的改革拟定了一个大致方向。兹简单列举如下: (1) 率先提出反对个人崇拜，停止节日期间在建筑物上悬挂和在游行队伍中高举领袖像; (2)着手平反冤假错案，终止了 “医生谋杀案”，发起了 1953 年大赦，从集中营、流放地和监狱释放了一百多万人; (3) 限制内务部特别会议[14]的权限，禁止刑讯逼供; (4) 改革户籍管理制度，规定在外地找到工作的农民可以领取临时身份证，开始结束苏联农民几十年没有身份证的历史; (5) 从具体情况出发，主张在波罗的海三国、西乌克兰和西白俄罗斯不搞集体化; (6) 在民族关系上，主张扩大加盟共和国的权限，多用地方民族干部，并为格鲁吉亚的 “明格列尔案”平反; (7) 提出苏联的防御性炸弹已够多，主张削减军费，多发展经济; (8) 主张缓和国际局势，认为两德统一不可避免，不要求东德搞社会主义，和平的德国才符合苏联的利益; (9) 主张恢复和改善同南斯拉夫的关系等[15]。这就是苏联历史上所谓的 “百日维新”。在短短一百多天的时间里，提出并实施如此多的重大改革措施，这在社会主义国家改革史上是空前的，充分说明贝利亚不是心血来潮，而是出于对苏联国内外形势和所存在问题的深思熟虑，是想改变斯大林不得人心的政策。对此，苏联著名外交家特罗扬诺夫斯基曾这样评价: “虽然当时的第一号人物是部长会议主席马林科夫，实际上起主导作用的却是贝利亚……他是为达到自己的目的而不择手段的人，还是一个拥有非凡智慧和巨大组织才能的人。”[16]上述措施在 “贝利亚事件”后统统成了他的罪状，虽然后来赫鲁晓夫继续实施了这些政策。 <br><br>

在这一百多天里，贝利亚并没有关注自身的安全，而是集中精力搞改革，而赫鲁晓夫等人恰恰就是这时候在幕后积极活动，把矛头对准了贝利亚。贝利亚为什么会成为众矢之的呢? 首先，他控制的安全部门是让人闻风丧胆的机构，早在斯大林时期，安全部门就是斯大林消灭竞争对手、潜在敌人、异己分子的强有力工具。虽然前两任安全部门头子亚戈达和叶若夫都没有好下场，但其余威依然存在。其次，贝利亚手中拥有最令人不安的关于每一位领导人的个人资料。斯大林喜欢用有问题的干部，因为这是控制他们的辫子。为斯大林收集领导人的资料，是安全部门一项重要的机密任务。正因如此，斯 大林一闭眼，新领导人的首要工作就是接收斯大林掌握的档案。莫洛托夫曾说: “他(贝利亚) 掌握着所有人的专案文件，也掌握斯大林的专案文件，当然，也有我的。”[17]再次，贝利亚提出的一系列改革措施，其他领导人没有思想准备，跟不上，而这些都是非常得民心的举措，会使贝利亚因此更加得势。于是，贝利亚就成了他们必欲除之而后快的对象。
<br><br>
好在贝利亚的改革措施确实是苏联无法回避的改革方向，苏联要走出死胡同继续存在下去，就不能不开始纠正斯大林所犯的错误，不能不批判对斯大林的个人崇拜。贝利亚出师未捷身先死，但他所开始的改革事业却无人敢中断，只是被推迟了。

贝利亚与镇压活动<br><br>

作为安全机关的首脑，贝利亚最受诟病的就是他手上沾满无辜牺牲者的鲜血，他的名字经常同他血腥的前任亚戈达、叶若夫并列在一起。
<br><br>
十月革命胜利后，苏俄成立了镇压机关――肃清反革命委员会，即 “契卡”，后来改组为国家政治保卫局，再后来其职能被移交给内务人民委员部 (二战后改名为内务部) 。这些机构是苏联国家机器中执行镇压职能的机构，掌握着生杀大权。如果说在革命胜利之初镇压是必要的 (虽然被错杀的也不少) ，那么在国内战争结束之后，就应当及时转向国内和平或国内建设。二十年代初列宁时期也确实削减过契卡的权力，并对其进行过改组，但在斯大林执政后，提出了 “阶级斗争尖锐化”的理论，声称社会主义取得的成就越大，阶级斗争就越尖锐。这个错误的理论为大规模镇压提供了虚假的理论依据。正是在斯大林宣布建成社会主义的时候，镇压活动反而达到了高潮。那时，斯大林对在镇压中出了大力的内务人民委员亚戈达感到不满，1936 年 9 月 25 日他与日丹诺夫联名给政治局委员们发电报称: 亚戈达领导的国家政治保卫总局，在揭露托洛茨基―季诺维也夫集团这件事情上耽误了四年时间，应当让叶若夫担任内务人民委员。于是，就换上了更加残酷的叶若夫。1937―1938 年，苏联大地刮起了 “叶若夫旋风”，使国内的镇压活动达到了几乎疯狂的程度。
<br><br>
1938 年上半年，苏联结束了对布哈林、李可夫等人的审判，至此，斯大林的政治对手已被消灭殆尽，他决定降温。但是，单凭 “屠夫”叶若夫来降温是不行的，于是斯大林从老家格鲁吉亚调来了时任格鲁吉亚共产党第一书记的贝利亚。从最近公布的 《贝利亚日记》看来，贝利亚本人并不怎么愿意来莫斯科。他在这年的日记中写道:
<br><br>
7 月 29 日。我从来没有想过写日记，而现在想起写了。收到斯大林同志的亲笔信，他建议我去莫斯科从事契卡工作，担任叶若夫的 (内务人民委员部) 第一副主席。他(斯大林) 是个复杂的人。他干了镇压的蠢事。内务人民委员部充满亚戈达和托洛茨基的人员。柯巴 (即斯大林) 写道，我是整个党的领导中一个了解契卡工作的人，只有我是唯一能够整顿工作的人。用觉悟来逼我，说把契卡整顿好，然后如果愿意你可以回老家。但柯巴信任我，给我权力，我已把格鲁吉亚搞得无人可比。等一切都搞好了，就把你拉夫连季调开，跑到莫斯科去逮间谍去。……麻烦事很多，而满意的很少。谁知道， 这些坏蛋把谁交出去，不把谁交出去。要好好地检查一切。就是这样，拉夫连季。柯巴不怜惜你，不让你安稳地呆在家里。
<br><br>
8 月 5 日。……这两年国内流了不少的血……要抓最活跃的。如果在格鲁吉亚要把所有的人都抓起来，那就要抓大约 5 万人，如果这样，就会有 20 万甚至更多的人不满。这里需要掌握分寸。
<br><br>
8 月 29 日。进入莫斯科生活。与尼古拉 (即叶若夫) 保持距离。我说了，对任命不感到高兴，本人没有提出请求，我最好在格鲁吉亚工作。但命令就是命令[18]。<br><br>

从日记中还可以看出，贝利亚当时对镇压还是比较冷静的。他的一些想法，同斯大 林 “降温”的打算不谋而合。
<br><br>
斯大林选中贝利亚也不是偶然的。1935 年，贝利亚出版了一本名为 《论外高加索布尔什维克组织历史中的问题》的小册子，大力吹捧斯大林，第一次提出布尔什维克党是“列宁斯大林的党”，提出了两个领袖――列宁和斯大林，两个革命中心――列宁的彼得堡和斯大林的外高加索。这自然博得了斯大林的欢心，为此授予他 “列宁奖金”。贝利亚在格鲁吉亚担任过共和国安全部门的头儿，后又升任格鲁吉亚共产党第一书记。这就是说，他既有安全工作的经验，又有党的工作经验，是符合斯大林的要求的。
<br><br>
当然，加强镇压或者缓和镇压，都不是哪个内务人民委员所能决定的，他们不过是执行斯大林意志的工具而已。贝利亚于 1938 年下半年来到莫斯科，从这年 11 月 25 日至1945 年 12 月 29 日任内务人民委员，这期间斯大林大镇压的高潮已经过去。因此，贝利亚对三十年代大镇压的 “贡献”并不大 (当然，格鲁吉亚的镇压是他领导的) 。在三十年代的镇压中，那些曾在死刑判决上签过字的是莫洛托夫、伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇等人，他们所应承担的责任远远超过了身处格鲁吉亚的贝利亚。不过，在贝利亚上任后的四十年代，他在实施镇压中也确实尽了力，其中包括 “卡廷森林事件”。最近公布的卡廷事件档案显示，对波兰军官的屠杀，就是贝利亚以内务人民委员的身份给斯大林打的报告，建议对他们处以极刑――枪毙，最后由斯大林等人签署，批准实施。
<br><br>
从 1946 年起，贝利亚已不再担任内务部长了。1946 年 3 月 18 日他担任了政治局委员，次日被任命为部长会议国防委员会主席。1946―1953 年间，他的主要工作是主持原子弹和火箭的研发，并在这个领域为苏联作出了突出的贡献。二战后不久，斯大林就开始了新一轮的镇压，当时起主要作用的应是主管意识形态的中央书记日丹诺夫和内务部长克鲁格洛夫。 从以上情况可以看出，贝利亚在斯大林的镇压中是起过作用的，手上肯定沾有无辜者的鲜血，但其所应承担的罪责不会超过斯大林，也不会超过斯大林的那些 “亲密战友”。也许是这个缘故，使他后来在平反冤假错案时能够放开手脚。
<br><br>
总之，贝利亚之死至今仍是一个谜，本文只能根据现有的材料指出较大可能性。不过，无论贝利亚是怎么死的，剪除贝利亚本身是一个确定不移的历史事实。大量事实说明，剪除贝利亚是赫鲁晓夫策划的一场不折不扣的政变。他离间马林科夫和贝利亚，策动其他主席团委员反贝利亚，动用国防军将领搞突然袭击，不经法律程序就除掉了党内二号人物，然后又编造种种谎言，掩盖其无法无天的做法。这是斯大林镇压手段的继续，极其残酷，难怪几年后当马林科夫、莫洛托夫被打成 “反党集团”时，要打电话给赫鲁晓夫，求他保留他们的性命。
<br><br>
政变大体上可以分为两种: 一种是因政见之争，为实施自己的路线方针政策而发动政变; 另一种则是因权力之争，以谋取自己的最大利益为目标。赫鲁晓夫剪除贝利亚的政变，是一场典型的争权斗争，从后来实行的政策看，他同贝利亚并无原则分歧。这场政变清除了赫鲁晓夫飞黄腾达路上的最大障碍，并为以后清除马林科夫、独揽大权准备 了条件。莫洛托夫也承认这是赫鲁晓夫主谋的一场政变。丘耶夫在同莫洛托夫谈话时问道: “简言之，策划了政变。可以这样说吗?”莫洛托夫回答说: “是的，是的……在政治局把他 (贝利亚) 抓起来了。…… (赫鲁晓夫) 是整个事件的组织者……对付贝利亚的措施，是赫鲁晓夫提出来的。”[19]

【内容提要】　“贝利亚（Beria）事件”是斯大林逝世后苏联政坛上的重大政治事件。1953年6月26日，担任部长会议副主席兼任内务部部长的贝利亚，突然被秘密逮捕，随后被苏联当局指控“反党、反国家罪行”并被枪毙。苏联当局对“贝利亚事件”的正统说法沿用了近半个世纪。“贝利亚事件”的真实面目鲜为人知，实际上，当年的指控是凭空捏造的，存在罪名不符的问题，它是斯大林逝世后苏联高层权力斗争的产物。<br><br>

“贝利亚事件”是苏联历史中的诸多谜案之一，几十年以来，对此事件说法不一。<br><br>

1953年苏共中央七月全会结束后，7月10日苏联媒体首次公开报道了“贝利亚事件”，党的机关报《真理报》刊登了简讯：苏共召开中央全会，讨论了马林科夫代表中央主席团所作的《关于贝利亚的反党、反国家罪行》的报告，指控贝利亚破坏苏维埃国家，为国外资本家服务，企图把内务部凌驾于政府和苏联共产党之上；全会通过决议取消贝利亚的中央委员会资格，并把他作为苏联共产党和苏维埃人民的敌人而开除出党[1]。同日，解除了贝利亚的部长会议第一副主席和内务部长的 职务，移交苏联最高法院审理。随后各出版机关和图书馆奉命销毁了贝利亚的有关资料，大百科全书中的条目也奉命被覆盖粘贴。<br><br>

近年来，新解密档案材料为人们了解事实真相提供了依据。尤其是《贝利亚在1953年，苏共中央七月全会速记记录及其他文件集》[2]，集中了从斯大林逝世到贝利亚被枪决之间苏联当局的一些有关原始资料，为了解“贝利亚事件”真相提供了帮助。贝利亚也越来越引起俄罗斯史学家、文学家们的关注，出现了一些专著[3]、论文以及相关书籍的专门章节[4]，其评论不一，争论激烈。一些人仍视他为血腥恶魔的政治家、阴谋家；另一些人则认为，贝利亚是位颇有领导能力的国务活动家，其在镇压中的过错实际上并不比莫洛托夫和赫鲁晓夫这些政治局委员的过错大，只是他在1953年夏激烈的政治斗争中被打败，否则，激进改革的主要发起人的形象是会与贝利亚的名字连在一起的。为了能够冷静地、客观地、历史地评价贝利亚和“贝利亚事件”，首先让我们一起了解一下贝利亚的主要国务活动。<br><br>

一　贝利亚的主要国务活动<br><br>

被苏联当局从苏联百科全书中删除了近半个世纪的贝利亚，如今重新拥有独立的条目。根据苏联政治精英百科辞典――《绝密人物生平百科》[5]，贝利亚自20年代初领导高加索肃反委员会，1931年起任格鲁吉亚共产党中央第一书记，1938年11月起被任命为内务人民委员(即内务部部长)[6]，1939年春当选为联共(布)中央委员会政治局候补委员。1941年任人民委员会副主席(后来称部长会议副主席)，主抓煤炭、石油和金属工业及重工业、军工综合体，随后进入战时最高权力机构国防委员会，负责监督飞机、坦克、武器、弹药的生产，因卫国战争中的突出贡献而晋升为苏联元帅，被授予“社会主义劳动英雄”及一系列勋章、奖章。战后任国防委员会特别委员会主席，负责领导研制原子弹工作。自1946年3月起当选为政治局委员。斯大林逝世后，贝利亚担任部长会议副主席兼任内务部部长(国家安全部也并入其中)，期间提出一系列纠正以往错误的大胆举措。1953年6月26日被当局秘密逮捕，12月23日被枪毙。<br><br>

简言之，贝利亚是40~50年代苏联高层领导集团的核心人物之一。<br><br>

斯大林时期，调入中央工作后的贝利亚参与的重大事件主要有：出任内务人民委员，迅速整顿国家安全机关[7]，从劳改营、教养院分别释放了22.36万人和10.38万人，但同时也逮捕了许多人，镇压活动并没终止；其次，领导内务人民委员部对侨居墨西哥的托洛茨基实施暗杀[8]；再次，整肃外交部[9]，为苏德“合作”排除“干扰”；第四，参与“卡廷事件”[10]，奉命接管棘手的波兰战俘约25万人，并根据1940年3月5日政治局通过的决议秘密处决2万多名前波兰军官[11]；第五，指挥强制性的民族迁徙行动[12]；第六，负责领导原子弹的研制工作，领导苏联情报机关从国外获取原子弹研制的机密，并负责原料铀的开发，1945年秋任原子弹特别委员会主席，负责组织工作并督促保障完成任务。1949年秋苏联第一枚原子弹爆炸成功，为此联共(布)中央和部长会议专门嘉奖贝利亚列宁勋章和一等斯大林奖金，有人称其为“苏联 原子弹之父”[13]。其后，贝利亚继续负责主抓苏联氢弹的研制工作，结果比美国早一年研制出来，为苏联的大国地位提供了军事保障。
<br><br>
斯大林逝世后，熟知苏联国内外局势的贝利亚，向苏共中央委员会主席团迅速提出了一系列纠正错误的大胆举措和提案，并亲自主抓落实一些议案，展现了其政治生涯的另一面――精明能干的政治家、尝试改革的先行者。
<br><br>
斯大林逝世后，首先是贝利亚主动发起苏联平反冤假错案工作。他签署绝密文件，下令成立专项侦查小组，重新审查斯大林晚年的“医生案件”、“前苏联空军领导人和苏联航空工业部的领 导被控案”、“明格列尔案件”等有重大影响的一系列案件[14]。根据重新审查的结果，贝利亚迅速向苏共中央主席团递交了上述一系列案件的复审报告和予以平反的提案。苏共中央主席团批准了上述报告，其涉案人员都得到了平反，并被恢复名誉。<br><br>

贝利亚坚持把他签署的案件复审报告和其他材料附在苏共中央主席团的相关决议后面，分发给中央委员、候补委员以及各地方州委书记等人。贝利亚展示给社会的是反对滥用职权和反对政治迫害的形象，也许他有以此赢得民心、捞取政治资本的动机，但无法否认贝利亚的复查报告和提议平反议案的积极意义，它确实拉开了苏联平反冤假错案的大幕，而且起到了打破社会政治僵局、提高领导集团威信的作用。
<br><br>
1953年3月26日，贝利亚还向苏共中央主席团递交了大赦草案报告，指出劳改营、监狱和集中营服刑的犯人多达252.64万人[15]，占1951年初苏联总人口的1.39%，造成监狱、劳改营人满为患。大赦草案提议释放上百万人[16]，获苏共中央主席团的批准，1953年3月28日《真理报》头版刊登了“最高苏维埃主席团大赦令”。它带给苏联社会的震动是很大的，“给被判刑剥夺自由在5年以上者的刑期减半”条款扩大了大赦的受益人群，使大赦的意义不只局限于释放103.2万人回家，对稳定社会情绪起到了一定作用。但“大赦令不适用于反革命罪”犯人(这一提法是苏联政治犯的代名词)，使广大的政治迫害受害者继续含冤服刑。这也从一个侧面说明，无论是贝利亚还是其他高层领导人，都不可能完全告别斯大林时代，他们也无意于一下子抛弃原有的专制管理模式，所做的只是对其进行修补而已。
<br><br>
此外，贝利亚还递交了关于限制苏联内务部特别会议权限的报告[17]，提议修改刑法内容，从法律上纠正镇压范围过大的做法和减少民众的不满，明确提议取消某些经济罪、失职罪的刑事责任[18]。贝利亚曾向米高扬谈过其主要想法：“应当恢复法制，不能容忍国内目前这种状况。我们逮捕了许多人，应该释放他们。应当精简内务部。”[19]
<br><br>
改革户籍管理是贝利亚提出的另一项影响较大的对高度专制管理模式进行修补的缓和举措，因为对自由往来和居住的限制越来越引起国民的不满，中央主席团讨论并通过了贝利亚的“取消护照加注和特别受理地区”报告。贝利亚还对不给农民发放国内护照(即长期有效的多页身份证件)的做法提出尖锐批评，签署内务部第00 357号令，规定在其他地区找到工作的农民可领取临时护照。这一措施冲击了苏联集体农庄体制，因此 遭到其他领导人的反对，贝利亚被逮捕后这项措施也被取消[20]。<br><br>

贝利亚在其递交给苏共中央主席团的报告中也间接地谈到农业问题――大量农庄庄员收入很低，他主张“发展农庄的公有经济和提高农庄农民的物质福利，降低首先是山区和半山区农庄的农产品国家采购定额和规定的现金支付定额”[21]。<br><br>

在完善民族政策方面，贝利亚向苏共中央主席团递交了关于乌克兰西部、立陶宛、白俄罗斯形势的报告，提出起用地方民族领导干部来替换俄罗斯籍最高领导人的举措，预防爆发非俄罗斯族的民族反抗。这是一种应急性的缓解紧张关系的 举措，对此甚至其政治竞争对手赫鲁晓夫后来也承认其正确性[22]。<br><br>

在改善国际关系方面，贝利亚秘密谋划苏联和南斯拉夫关系正常化，密切关注民主德国严峻的政治、经济局势，主张修改对德政策，大胆地提出极具政治冒险性的尝试――主张在民主德国放弃移植斯大林模式的社会主义建设，放弃在农村建立集体农庄的方针，主张在民主德国推行中立的和平德国方针，但遭到莫洛托夫等人的坚决反对，最终导致东柏林的6月骚乱，苏联动用武力进行镇压。<br><br>

上述是贝利亚百日施政的主要举措。苏联高层领导集团采纳这些提议，是面对斯大林时期造成的严重现实危机所做的自救反应，旨在争取民心、恢复正常秩序，一定程度上缓解、消除民众心中的不满，缓解已日益激化的社会矛盾。这也说明，继斯大林之后，无论何人执掌国家管理大权，都必须改革原有的高度集中的管理模式，做出顺应民心的举措。<br><br>

苏联著名资深外交家、国务活动家奥・特罗扬诺夫斯基曾评价说：“虽然当时的第一号人物是部长会议主席马林科夫，而实际上起主导作用的却是贝利亚……他是为达到自己的目的而不择手段的人，他还是一个拥有非凡智慧和巨大组织才能的人。”[23]<br><br>

贝利亚的上述一系列改革措施，大体上符合当时苏联的社会现实，显示了其管理才能，但同时也引起了苏联高层政治精英们的不满、猜疑与忌惮。贝利亚把国家安全部并入内务部后迅速进行人事变动，提议更换各加盟共和国、自治共和国及6个区和49个州的内务部领导人[24]，随后更换了各地方中级领导层，如出任乌克兰内务部部长的梅什克立即撤换了18名乌克兰各州内务部管理局长[25]。这种人事变动被贝利亚的同僚们视为“极其危险的行动”，他们本来就对从斯大林时代继承下来的国家安全机关在社会中的特殊作用(包括对推荐和调转党务、国务和经济干部拥有决定权)怀有不满，因此出于对权势日盛的贝利亚的共同的恐惧而联合起来，密谋以宫廷政变的方式逮捕贝利亚，这一结果就是“贝利亚事件”。<br><br>

二　“贝利亚事件”始末<br><br>

官方是在7月10日的《真理报》上公开发表了极为简略的报道。当时苏联官方对何时、何地、如何逮捕贝利亚的，没有任何公开报道，这一直是人们心中的谜案。<br><br>

事实上，贝利亚是1953年6月26日在克里姆林宫参加苏共中央主席团会议时被突然逮捕的，是根据党的高层领导者们的密谋实施的，依靠的是以朱可夫元帅为首的军人特别武装小组。俄罗斯著名历史学家В.瑙莫夫评价说，“这在苏联历史上是史无前例的”[26]。
<br><br>

##朱可夫元帅为首的军人特别武装小组：在amazon，没货。Siloviki<br><br>

##《朱可夫元帅战争回忆录》问世后，立即引起轰动，头两版就在苏联印了360万册，并翻译成17种文字，在26个国家出版。1995年，为纪念在第二次世界大战中战胜法西斯50周年，莫斯科新闻出版社出版了由朱可夫的女儿玛丽亚根据朱可夫的原稿和档案材料修订的最忠实于作者原著的新版本。该版本恢复了原稿被删去的有关苏联卫国战争前武装力量建设进程及战争准备等情况和对斯大林在卫国战争中的作用和许多事件的评价。<br><br>

马林科夫在中央七月全会上说，关于贝利亚的问题最初始自6月12日中央主席团的一次例会，是在讨论完贝利亚提交的关于白俄罗斯局势的报告之后，开始私下秘密商议的。<br><br>

赫鲁晓夫在其回忆录中承认是他首先向马林科夫提出贝利亚的危险性，并表示已同国防部长布尔加宁谈过多次，从而说服了马林科夫同他结成反对贝利亚的政治联盟。随后的一周多时间里，马林科夫和赫鲁晓夫分头同主席团某些成员就解决贝利亚问题进行了秘密谈话。赫鲁晓夫比较顺利地说服了卡冈诺维奇和萨布罗夫，但最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫最初并不赞同赫鲁 晓夫的提议，对逮捕贝利亚持不积极态度，后来由马林科夫和莫洛托夫出面才被说服。莫洛托夫不仅积极支持搞垮贝利亚，而且首先主张采取极端措施。马林科夫最初也没能说服别尔乌辛，后由赫鲁晓夫出面解决。最后找的是米高扬，他同意解除贝利亚现任职务，但主张用同志式的方法，让其改抓经济工作。可见，在秘密策划中起决定性作用的是赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁、马林科夫和莫洛托夫。<br><br>

经过周密的谋划准备，1953年6月26日在苏共中央主席团会议上出奇不备地将贝利亚逮捕。据赫鲁晓夫讲，莫斯科空防司令莫斯卡连科和朱可夫元帅等11位元帅和将军参加了武力逮捕贝利亚的行动。会上赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁、莫洛托夫等发言，揭发、批判贝利亚，随即对贝利亚进行武装监护[27]。晚上才把贝利亚从克里姆林宫秘密送到莫斯科卫戍部队禁闭室，次日又把他转到防空司令部的仓库进行关押，直到审讯和审判结束[28]。<br><br>

据查证，6月26日的苏共中央主席团会议没有留下任何速记记录，目前能找到的能说明这次会议的唯一官方文件，是收藏在俄罗斯联邦总统档案馆内的马林科夫在中央主席团会议上的发言草稿――“关于贝利亚问题的决定第10号记录，1953年6月26日”[29]。该文件显示，会上并没有列出贝利亚具体的真凭实据的犯罪事实，只是笼统地谴责贝利亚及其副手们将内务部凌驾于党和政府之上，导致内务机构有机会滥用职权，进行违法犯罪活动。文件有针对性提出了今后任务――对内务部机构进行治理整顿，使其处于党的监督之下，为党和政府服务；而在“怎样纠正?”项下，对贝利亚的处理意见――“解除其部长会议副主席职务、任命为石油工业部长?”旁写有“缓议”一词[30]，可见主席团成员们对这项处理意见是存在不同看法的。<br><br>

苏联最高苏维埃主席团26日做出“关于贝利亚反国家罪行”决议，解除贝利亚部长会议副主席和内务部长的职务，取消他曾获得过的一切荣誉称号和勋章[31]，移交苏联最高法院审理。<br><br>

三天后苏共中央主席团会议通过了《关于立案侦查贝利亚反党和反国家罪行》的决议，并委托由赫鲁晓夫一手提拔的、其职务也是这次会上批准的苏联总检察长Р.鲁坚科，负责贝利亚事件的侦查，由其确定专案组成员名单，立即着手揭露和调查贝利亚及其副手们进行反党、反国家的罪行[32]。苏共中央主席团会议紧急撤换总检察长并责其调查贝利亚事件的这种做法，很难让人相信，对贝利亚案件的侦查和取证工作是公正的、客观的，换言之，它为党和国家领导人操纵最高法院特 别法庭判处贝利亚死刑做好了准备[33]。<br><br>

根据6月27日赫鲁晓夫签署的决议[34]，7月2日~7日，苏共中央匆忙召开全会，着重揭露和批判了贝利亚的反党和反国家罪行，这就是苏联历史上有名的“苏共中央七月全会”。贝利亚没被允许参加。在这次会上马林科夫做了关于贝利亚反党和反国家罪行的报告，赫鲁晓夫、莫洛托夫、伏洛希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇等主席团主要成员以及部分代表都做了发言，从思想上、政治上检举、声讨贝利亚罪行。与会代表们的发言把贝利亚勾画成血腥刽子手、帝国主义的间谍、贪恋权力的阴谋家、道德败坏的野心家。七月全会通过了关于贝利亚反党、反国家罪行的决议。<br><br>

7月初《真理报》除了刊登了本文开头提到的简讯之外，还发表了社论《党、政府、苏联人民的不可摧毁的团结》[35]，指责贝利亚“企图把内务部凌驾于党和政府之上”，并罗列了四条罪行：“第一，企图利用内务部中央和地方的机构来反对党和党的领导、反对苏联政府，根据对他个人的忠诚来提拔内务部的工作人员；第二，企图阻挠农业方面最重大的迫切问题的解决；第三，企图破坏苏联各族人民的友谊，企图在苏联各族之间制造纠纷，并唆使各加盟共和国中的资产阶级民族分子进行活 动；第四，蓄意阻挠执行党中央委员会和苏维埃政府关于巩固苏维埃法律和消除某些违法乱纪情况的指示，并多次企图曲解这些指示。”根据新解密的档案文献显示，上述罪名均摘自未发表的苏共中央“七月全会”关于贝利亚罪行的决议[36]。29日苏共中央主席团通过决议，取消贝利亚的苏联最高苏维埃代表资格。<br><br>

1953年年底，确切地说是12月7日，苏联最高监察院发布通报，宣布完成了对贝利亚案件的侦讯工作，结论是贝利亚组织了与苏维埃国家为敌的阴谋叛国集团[37]，并重复了《真理报》社论中罗列的上述罪行[38]。23日苏共中央报刊发表公告：苏联最高法院特别法庭对贝利亚一案进行了秘密审判(18日至23日)，判处贝利亚及其“同伙”死刑，没收其财产，不得上诉，并立即执行枪决。审判贝利亚的程序完全是按照苏联30~40年代的政治诉讼程序的传统进行的，先由苏共中央全会做出决议(关于贝利亚的旨在颠覆苏维埃国家以有利于外国资本主义、其表现为居心险恶地企图把苏联内务部置于政府和苏联共产党之上的反党反国家的犯罪)，预先就决定了几个月后才举行的庭审的判决结论，并且采取的是缺席审判，被告本人不被允许参加庭审，也就无从做出解释和申辩。<br><br>

就这样，苏联最高法院特别法庭顺从地执行了党和国家领导的意志，判处枪决贝利亚并直接在关押处执行。至此，“贝利亚事件”落下帷幕。自此贝利亚便被人为地塑造成恶贯满盈的阴谋钻营、道德败坏的帝国主义间谍，是大规模清洗运动和冤假错案的罪魁。<br><br>

三　七月全会和贝利亚的三封悔改信<br><br>

苏共中央七月全会的主要议题是检举、揭发、批判贝利亚，赫鲁晓夫主持了开幕式，讨论马林科夫的报告《关于贝利亚反党和反国家罪行》。从七月全会速记记录中我们可以看出，无论是马林科夫的报告，还是赫鲁晓夫的讲话以及其他委员的发言，对贝利亚的指责主要是政治性的。他们都步调一致地按照主席团定的调子对贝利亚进行指控、上纲上线并自我洗刷，极力把斯大林逝世后贝利亚通过中央主席团采取的一系列措施，说成是贝利亚企图把内务部凌驾于党和政府领导之上，把纠正民族政策上的错误说成挑拨各民族之间的关系，把其处理民主德国问题的建议说成“帝国主义的代理人的罪证”。<br><br>

新近出版的解密档案材料首次全文发表苏共中央七月全会(1953年)的完整材料，它向我们揭示了一个非常重要的事实――七月全会的会议速记记录竟然有两个版本，一个是原始的会议速记记录，即未经修改的反映全会上实际讲话的速记记录(原件现保存在俄罗斯国家现代史档案馆)；另一个是会后经过修改的速记记录，也就是进行了变动、增删以交付印刷的速记记录。<br><br>

1953年9月18日苏共中央主席团通过“关于出版七月全会和九月全会(1953年)速记稿”的决议，定于10月1日前出版。决议明确要求“对发出速记稿尚未核对的同志在一周时间内核对自己的讲话”。此决议为变动、修改七月全会速记记录打开了方便之门。从七月全会到10月初，苏联高层政治力量的对比发生了变化，赫鲁晓夫在苏共中央九月全会上被正式批准为苏共中央第一书记，成为党的第一把手，跃居在马林科夫的前面。许多委员们根据时局的变化对自己的讲话稿做了彻底修改。由于七月全会后贝利亚在党的宣传中受到致命的批判，以至于委员们以前关于同贝利亚关系密切、关于内务部长的智慧和经验的讲话变得不合适了；其次要求减少贝利亚改革国家内外政策计划的材料，这一切均由对“敌人、卑鄙的阴谋家、外国情报机构间谍”――贝利亚的指控所取代。许多委员不仅修改个别细节、事实和措词，而且还改变原来讲话的意思，有的发言稿还被怀疑是重写的[39]。值得一提的是，赫鲁晓夫和莫洛托夫的发言也都作了重大修改[40]。<br><br>

狱中贝利亚曾先后给苏共中央委员会和中央主席团写了三封信[41]，为我们了解《贝利亚事件》的起因以及贝利亚的国务活动都提供了不可或缺的重要材料，也是贝利亚能为后人留下的唯一能表明他自己对该事件的态度的宝贵资料。7月1日写的第二封信，手稿长达9页，可以视其为无法参加七月全会的一个书面发言。他诚恳地请求原谅：“我对自己的全部行为作了最严厉的反省，严厉地责骂自己。我对您(指马林科夫)的态度在性质上特别严重和不能原谅。我是百分之百地错了。”他承认坚持要把内务部的报告同中央决定一起散发的想法是错误的，认识到这样做在一定程度上贬低了中央决定本身的意义，“从我方面来说坚持散发报告是愚蠢的，是政治考虑不周，更何况您曾告诫我不要这样做。”信中贝利亚还回忆了与马林科夫以及其他主席团成员之间多年的工作友谊和相互提携，也间接地表白了自己在国务活动方面所做过的成绩和工作，并请求“安排做点工作吧!哪儿都行，任何需要的工作、最细小的工作都行……在任何一个边区和州、国营农场、农庄、建筑工地，恳求您不要使我失去成为一名积极的建设者……直到生命的最后一息，我仍将忠于我们亲爱的党和苏联政府。”<br><br>

次日，贝利亚给主席团所有成员写了封短信， 恳请大家立即干预，“有人想不经审判和侦查就迫害我，5天关押后一次审问也没有……难道作为中央主席团委员不应要求对他的案件仔细审理，提出指控，要求解释，讯问证人……对一位中央委员和自己的同志不经审判和弄清情况，在地下室蹲5天5夜后处死他，难道是唯一的和正确的解决方法……我断言，只要愿意进行调查，一切指控将被撤销……我请马林科夫同志和赫鲁晓夫同志不要固执，给同志平反难道不好吗?”一连串简短的语句表达了贝利亚无助的心情，也间接地说明贝利亚对没有被允许参加中央全会的彻底失望， 同时他确信其同僚们拿不出什么不牵扯他们自己的真凭实据的指控。”<br><br>

负责监管贝利亚的К.С.莫斯卡连科将军在其回忆录中证实说：“所有这些信我们都呈递给了主席团委员马林科夫、赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁。后来我们得到指示，不许再给他纸、铅笔、钢笔，也就是禁止他写，我们就遵照执行。”[42]由此可见，后来贝利亚连申述权也被完全剥夺了，他的竞争者们竟然对他手中的笔都害怕。<br><br>

事实上，贝利亚的这些信不仅没有拿到中央全会上宣读，甚至没有让中央主席团全体委员审阅，他的请求也没有得到批准，其同僚们为了保全自身，把贝利亚作为造成斯大林时代所犯下错误 的主要罪魁，以此来洗刷自己，这正是贝利亚悲剧之所在。<br><br>
<a href= "link01.html">俄罗斯和德国在历史反思问题上的分歧与争论</a><br><br>

四　“贝利亚事件”深层原因<br><br>

斯大林逝世后，政治精英们开始对国家权力重新分配。1953年3月5日晚召开了苏共中央、苏联部长会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团联席会议。会上经贝利亚提议确立马林科夫为部长会议主席，贝利亚任部长会议第一副主席，赫鲁晓夫任苏共中央书记。此外，会上还通过了一项“绝密”议案：苏共中央主席团常务委员会授权马林科夫、贝利亚和赫鲁晓夫采取措施，整理斯大林同志的文件，无论是正在执行使用的文件还是档案文件。对此有评论认 为，“它是了解随后发生各种事件实质的关键，实际上它说出了斯大林主要接班人的名字，因此他们很快就得决定，这三个人中谁将成为头号人物。”[43]<br><br>

由此我们不难理解，马林科夫同意与赫鲁晓夫结成反对贝利亚的政治同盟的动机所在。另外，贝利亚的儿子谢尔戈曾在书中披露：“我父亲搞了一份马林科夫的材料，包括他的所有活动以及根据他主动提议所犯下的罪行(马林科夫参与了集体化和所有清洗运动)，我父亲曾对他说：‘算你走运，这些材料在我手里，不过以后你做事要明智些。’(逮捕贝利亚及其家属后，马林科夫曾亲自 找贝利亚的儿子索要贝利亚手中的档案，无获而归，非常恼火)”[44]。当然，贝利亚手中掌握的不只有马林科夫的“把柄”，还有主席团其他成员的类似“把柄”。正是对这种威胁性的担忧，使他们联合起来反对贝利亚，以此洗脱各自与过去错误的干系。<br><br>

历史学家德・沃尔科戈诺夫在其书中的讲述也证明了这一点：“当贝利亚被逮捕时，赫鲁晓夫下令把保存有斯大林发给内务人民委员部的许多文件的贝利亚私人档案也‘全部都带走’。为此成立的专门委员会，出于‘善意’考虑，没翻看也没去读，就执行命令把11袋文件全部都烧毁了呀!很可能，这些文件都是独有的一份呀……党的高 层领导们害怕，这些文件中有他们的黑材料，斯大林发给贝利亚的许多命令和决议，都被扔到专门委员会点起的火堆上烧了，永远成了历史的秘密。”[45]<br><br>

在分析“贝利亚事件”时，研究苏联战后时期的著名学者叶・祖布科娃谈论说，“贝利亚事件”是斯大林逝世后苏联高层权力斗争的产物。“事件”产生的真正原因是贝利亚采取的一系列措施使其作用日益显赫，而这些措施触动了他的同僚们的权势欲，引起了他们的惶恐，使他们担心会影响到自己的切身利益。在数年间里，内务部获得了过多的权力，实际上已经超出了党的监督范围。他的同僚们不 无理由地看到了这里存在的对自己以及自己生存的现实危险性，是恐惧感使他们联合起来共同反对贝利亚，把贝利亚从政治舞台上清除掉。事实上，逮捕贝利亚、削减强力机关的过大权力，这既符合赫鲁晓夫的利益，也符合马林科夫的利益。<br><br>

贝利亚的儿子在其回忆录中写道：“父亲是一位追究真实结果的务实的国务活动家”，“父亲错在过高地估计了周围同僚们对举措议案的赞同，同时也没有充分估计到他们施展阴谋诡计的‘才华’”[46]。<br><br>

贝利亚的昔日同僚们――他的政治竞争对手们，也极力地把一切都推到贝利亚身上。中央主席团成员以及委员们在“七月全会”上的发言就集中地体现了这一点。1955年赫鲁晓夫在访问南斯拉夫时，在公开声明中就曾把过去破坏苏南关系的罪责统统推到贝利亚和阿巴库莫夫身上，这引起铁托极大的不满。赫鲁晓夫在苏共二十大上所作的《关于个人崇拜及其后果》的报告中，也极力把贝利亚同战后斯大林时期的镇压活动绑在一起：“斯大林极重的猜疑心被卑鄙的奸细、可恶的敌人贝利亚巧妙地加以利用……正是贝利亚向斯大林‘抛出’了他和他的心腹一手炮制的材料……斯大林是从贝利亚和阿巴库莫夫那里获得了某些伪造材料……在策划五花八门的肮脏可耻的案件中，我党的凶恶敌人、外国间谍机关的走狗、骗取了斯大林信任的贝利亚起了最卑鄙的作用”[47]。<br><br>

赫鲁晓夫在各种场合曾多次不厌其烦地解释贝利亚问题，而且往往前后说法不一致，可见是有其目的的。
<br><br>
俄罗斯著名历史学家В.瑙莫夫、Ю.希卡乔夫在《贝利亚在1953年，苏共中央七月全会速记记录及其他文件集》的序言中评论说：“实际上，贝利亚事件是政治局反对其某成员的阴谋，这场阴谋的全部要素俱在：极端保密、秘密起草指控条款、认真推敲行动计划、幕后进行密谈、分配角色和组织执行逮捕的武装军官小组”；“贝利亚被剪除后，斯大林逝世后争夺党和国家领袖的斗争第一阶段宣告结束。在这场斗争中，赫鲁晓夫是最大的赢家：他在党内的领导地位大大加强。”[48]<br><br>

究其实质来说，“贝利亚事件”是斯大林逝世后苏联高层权力斗争的产物。由于强力部门的权力过大，超越了党的监督，对社会造成极大危害，因此，作为强力部门的领导者、大清洗运动的执行者，贝利亚也就成了斯大林时代大清洗镇压错误的“承担者”，对其担任内务部的领导期间所参与的镇压活动负有不可推卸的责任。<br><br>

五　尾声：“贝利亚事件”的平反问题<br><br>

根据现已公布的档案史料来看，1953年指控贝利亚所犯的罪行――背叛祖国、组建反苏联阴谋团伙、从事恐怖主义活动、担任过秘密间谍，是属于当时为了权力斗争的需要而凭空捏造的，确实存在罪名不符的问题。<br><br>

但1999年10月和2000年5月，俄罗斯最高法院军事法庭两次驳回贝利亚亲属要求给贝利亚平反的上诉。<br><br>

为此，笔者走访了一些俄罗斯著名学者以及普通民众。有学者认为，尽管“贝利亚事件”确实存在罪名不符，但给贝利亚平反仍是不现实的。其原因在于：一方面，贝利亚长期以来一直被塑造成一个血腥镇压、阴谋钻营的帝国主义间谍，臭名昭著，在俄罗斯民众的意识当中埋下了很深的怨恨；另一方面，自1938年起贝利亚曾长期担任苏联内务部部长的职务，对斯大林时期的大规模镇压负有不可推卸的罪责，尽管斯大林的亲信们在这方面每个人也都有罪责，但在人们的意识和记忆深处，已经很难把贝利亚与斯大林时期的错误分割开来[49]。
<br><br>
俄罗斯著名历史学家罗伊・麦德维杰夫在回答笔者就这一问题的提问时，也明确表示“贝利亚事件”很难给予平反，因为确切地说，它不是司法问题，而是政治问题。<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士弗拉基米尔・米亚斯尼科夫在接受笔者的提问时也明确表达了类似观点，他认为，俄罗斯学术界依据新公布的档案对“贝利亚事件”及贝利亚在苏联历史上的作用进行重新评价，这是正常的，它能勾画出其真实历史面目，更接近客观事实。弗・米亚斯尼科夫院士回忆说，1953年3月斯大林突然逝世时，他正值大学时代，曾亲眼目睹了当时的历史进程，当时几乎所有的人都陷入无法自控的悲痛之中，客观地说，贝利亚当时表现得很冷静，操办一切事情。可以看出，贝利亚对如何使国家继续向前发展是怀有信心的，但有的学者把贝利亚捧成英明的改革家，过分夸大了其主张和作用，也是不符合历史事实的。弗・米亚斯尼 科夫院士进一步指出，“贝利亚事件”是苏联当时高层权力斗争的结果，但要给贝利亚平反会造成社会上思想混乱，因此他认为，不会予以平反。鉴于经贝利亚之手曾有几万无辜政治犯被枪杀，他强调说，即使是再过50年、100年也仍然不会给贝利亚平反。
<br><br>
《贝利亚在1953年，苏共中央七月全会速记记录及其他文件集》一书版权页上的内容提要中，赫然写道：“靠造假做法指控贝利亚所犯的罪行是凭空捏造的，但关于他所犯的真正暴行――组织大规模镇压运动，却只字不提。”
<br><br>
笔者认为，贝利亚自1938年年底起开始担任内务人民委员部部长，无论在30年代末至50年代初的一些重大事件中扮演何种角色――是主动、积极倡议者还是主要参与、执行者，也无论他所做的一切是为了维护以斯大林为首的苏维埃政权或是政治需要还是生性残酷，他对其在任期间苏联国内某些大规模的清洗和镇压活动都负有不可推卸的责任。
<br><br>
“当然，贝利亚对当局所犯的罪行是负有责任的，其实，瞬间变为严酷的审判官的贝利亚的‘亲密同志’――马林科夫、莫洛托夫、卡冈诺维奇、赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、米高扬、布尔加宁也一样负有责任。”[50]俄罗斯历史学家阿・托普特金也认为，贝利亚昔日的这些战友们对大清洗的参与以 及直接负有的责任实际上并不亚于贝利亚。他在其书中梳理了马林科夫、莫洛托夫、卡冈诺维奇、赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、米高扬、布尔加宁等人的简要升迁履历，并用详细的数字逐一列举了他们各自在大清洗运动中所参与以及经手批示的枪毙人数、抓捕进集中营的人数[51]。“但多年来，贝利亚在苏联社会意识中成了残暴统治者的象征，成了他自己所犯一切罪行和归咎于他的斯大林政权的错误的‘替罪羊’”[52]。<br><br>

因此，尽管“贝利亚事件”的曲直已经披露，但“贝利亚事件”却很难予以平反。也许将来会把追究贝利亚在清洗运动中的责任问题，与指控罪名 确实不符的“贝利亚事件”区分开来，以更客观的态度予以评价，或许时间会对“贝利亚事件”做出另外的答案。

1953年3月5日斯大林去世，3个多月后苏联部长会议第一副主席、内务部和国家安全部部长贝利亚就被逮捕，时隔半年又被处决。贝利亚为什么在斯大林去世后如此迅速地被从肉体上消灭，而且是被他从前的同事和战友消灭呢?贝利亚之死留下众多疑云，有关其死亡时间、死亡方式以及功过是非，40余年来众说纷纭。特别是近年来随着一些新档案的公布，对贝利亚的评价更是莫衷一是。本文试图分析斯大林死后苏联高层的权力斗争，从这场权力争夺战中找到贝利亚死亡的真正原因。<br><br>


在过度营销的时代，我们提供“更好的内容”和“更快的速度”。<br><br>
<a href="http://www.retter2012.com/">Retter is Better</a>, WE Create and Deliver Real Value!<br><br>


一、斯大林去世后最初的权力结构<br><br>

斯大林的去世在苏联最高领导层中形成了一 个奇特的政治真空，一个重要的问题是新的政权组成以及苏共上层权力的再分配。虽然中央全会宣称要恢复集体领导的原则，然而俄罗斯民族悠久的传统和苏维埃国家30多年的历史都要求一个能果断掌管国家事务的杰出领袖人物出现。斯大林掌握政权几十年，毫不手软地同一切可能侵犯其权力的人进行斗争。他不信任任何人，没有指定接班人，也没留下任何政治遗嘱。而斯大林身边“亲密”的同事和战友们虽然一直在盼望和等待着他的死，但谁也不敢在他还活着的时候就讨论继承人的问题――即使在狭小的圈子里，他们中也无一人能够被同事们公认为领袖。<br><br>

1953年3月9日，中央委员会、部长会议和最高苏维埃主席团召开联席会议。在贝利亚的提议下，马林科夫当选部长会议主席及苏共中央第一书记。而按马林科夫的提议，贝利亚就任合并后的内务部和国家安全部部长，兼任部长会议第一副主席。其他3位部长会议副主席是莫洛托夫、布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇。伏罗希洛夫担任最高苏维埃主席团主席。中央委员会主席团从30人减为10人，斯大林在党的十九大上提出的人选一个也没进来。这十人顺序排列为：马林科夫、贝利亚、莫洛托夫、伏罗希洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇、米高扬、萨布罗夫和别尔乌辛。排名顺序习惯上代表了一个人在政权体系中的地位，赫鲁晓夫这时只名列第五。
<br><br>
马林科夫在斯大林死前发挥了党内第二把手的作用，他主持中央主席团和部长会议主席团会议，在政府中代理斯大林主持政务，在党的十九大上他还代替斯大林作了总结报告。按说马林科夫接替斯大林的位置是顺理成章的事情，但他不够强硬和果断，无法像斯大林那样成为拥有惟一权力的人。贝利亚此时位居第二。赫鲁晓夫先是从莫斯科市委书记之职卸任，接着于1953年3月14日接替马林科夫担任中央第一书记。此时的中央委员会同斯大林后期已然不同，马林科夫作为政府首脑在全国的影响自然为他人所不及，但他还不具备斯大林一样的权威，在各州和加盟共和国等地方一级上，真正有实权的还是党的书记。而且此时，赫鲁晓夫作为马林科夫与贝利亚之间权力角逐的平衡人物，也被拉入了决策层的“三驾马车”。<br><br>

不过三人联盟没能维持多久，贝利亚对权力的野心促使他在这场政治争夺中过早地失去了耐心，从而成为众矢之的。<br><br>
<a href= "link07.html">少看电视多看书</a><br><br>

二、1953年3月―1953年6月的贝利亚<br><br>

最初贝利亚注意的中心是斯大林时代的政治大清洗。1953年3月，贝利亚下令成立4个专门委员会负责审查“医生谋杀案”和“米格列尔人事件”，专门委员会很快作出结论，认为这些全是国家安全机关用犯罪的方式伪造的，并对案件的受害人予以平反和释放。
<br><br>
4月4日，贝利亚签署命令，指出要追究前国家安全机关的一系列歪曲苏联法律、伪造证明、逮捕无罪公民的犯罪行为。4月5日，前中央委员会书记、国家安全部部长伊格纳季耶夫被解职。贝利亚还坚决要求把内务部有关国家安全机关犯罪活动的主要材料分送到党的各级组织，使之成为广大党员的共有财产。<br><br>

贝利亚抢先中央委员会主席团一步把内务部关于医生案件的处理通知发给中央机关报，以表明他恢复了被践踏的公正，采取了人道主义行动。但贝利亚的行为引起中央委员会主席团的不满，就在该通知发表的第二天，《真理报》刊发社论强调了在处理该案件过程中中央委员会的作用。<br><br>

当代一些评论文章借此强调贝利亚在斯大林死后平反中的作用。但事实上“医生案件”和“米格列尔人事件”恰好不是贝利亚参与的，而是斯大林想借指责国家安全部门失职将贝利亚调离恐怖系统的中心控制机构，因而指使国家保安部单独策划的。当时被捕的有贝利亚的下属保安部头子阿巴库莫夫，而接替其职的是马林科夫的下属伊格纳季耶夫。贝利亚借为两案件平反之机，重新调整了人员安排。而臭名昭著的“列宁格勒案件”则被束之高阁，这恰恰是贝利亚和马林科夫一手制造的。
<br><br>
1953年4月贝利亚为加强各共和国领导的本地人(非俄罗斯族)成分，规定各共和国第一书记的职位均须由本地人而非由莫斯科派遣的俄罗斯人担任。之后，贝利亚给中央委员会提交了一份报告，对党的中央委员会和共和国党组织在西乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波罗的海共和国民族政策中的严重错误和党的机关的活动予以揭露和严厉批评。在这里贝利亚试图以维护公正的民族共和国保护者的面目出现，他故意忽略了自己就是1944年将高加索人民大规模驱逐出境以及1947和1949年将土著居民从波罗的海共和国流放的组织者。贝利亚的报告引起中央委员会主席团其他成员的恐慌，因为他们与大镇压有着直接的关系，一旦报告公之于众，他们将面临生死存亡。这些报告显然在贝利亚的命运中起了决定性的作用，也就是在6月12日最后一次讨论这些报告之后的两周，贝利亚就被逮捕了。之后中央委员会主席团通过了一项专门决议，把这些报告从贝利亚案件笔录中消除。<br><br>

贝利亚也关心国家的经济问题。他看到国家困难的财政状况、经济的过度紧张，认为过大的投资额使国家难于支撑，建议收缩斯大林时代开始的“共产主义建设”，把解放出来的资源投入农业生产。一些大型项目如土库曼主运河、伏尔加至乌拉尔的运河、伏尔加至波罗的海水路以及一系列铁路和公路都停了下来。贝利亚的这一行为获得了广大州委书记的支持。
<br><br>
1953年5月，以拉科西・马加斯为首的匈牙利党和国家代表团来与苏共讨论匈牙利劳动党中央委员会第一书记与部长会议主席岗位分离的问题。克里姆林宫决定，拉科西留任匈牙利劳动党第一书记，而政府由纳吉主持。拉科西反对将党和政府的职责分开，他不满地反问苏共中央主席团：苏共中央委员会和苏联部长会议是如何实现职责划分的?当时贝利亚漫不经心地(按赫鲁晓夫的说法)回答：部长会议决定中央委员会，而中央委员会则从事干部和宣传工作。[1]这一说法曾引起激烈争论。
<br><br>
1951年1月―1953年4月，约有50万人从民主德国迁居西柏林和联邦德国，其中尤以1953年上半年居多。在苏共领导集团看来，这表明了民主德国领导集团工作存在严重问题。在苏共中央主席团会议上，贝利亚对此发表看法，他说：“德国这个社会主义给了我们什么?那里到底在搞怎样的社会主义?”[2]贝利亚主张东德只发展土地和生产工具协作社，而不要加速建设苏联集体农庄模式的农业集体化。贝利亚的建议遭到与会者的激烈反 对。但在今天评论家们看来，贝利亚在德国问题上的立场表明他曾想在德国东部进行有限的改革。
<br><br>
贝利亚提出个人崇拜的危害，提议禁止在游行时使用党和政府领导人的肖像。此举引起中央主席团其他成员的不安和警觉，他们认为这是贝利亚针对他们采取的行动。斯大林死后苏共的领导人们，特别是那些觊觎领袖之位的人，都在谋求自己威信的提高，贝利亚的决定对他们无疑是个重大打击。因此，贝利亚一被捕，这个决议立即被撤消了。<br><br>

三、末日审判<br><br>

逮捕贝利亚的密谋始于赫鲁晓夫，在赫的倡议下，马林科夫、伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁、莫洛托夫等 苏共中央主席团成员达成一致。1953年6月26日，马林科夫主持召开部长会议主席团和中央委员会主席团联席会议，同时邀请了红军高级将领朱可夫元帅、苏军总监察长科涅夫元帅、国防部副部长莫斯卡连科将军等出席。马林科夫在报告中指出，内务部是最容易滥用职权的机关，敌人妄图利用这个机关，甚至把它凌驾于党和国家之上。马林科夫总结贝利亚的错误主要有三：1、贝利亚提交的有关乌克兰、立陶宛、拉脱维亚和白俄罗斯的民族问题的报告；2、贝利亚坚持把内务部文件分送到地方党组织；3、贝利亚对匈牙利和德国问题的立场。就在 这次会议上，贝利亚被逮捕。
<br><br>
1953年6月29日，中央委员会主席团会议通过了“组织对贝利亚反党和反国家的犯罪行为进行侦讯”的决议。会上解除了总检察长萨弗诺夫的职务。鲁金科受命接替其职，他同意只是按照中央委员会主席团指定的事实进行侦讯。中央委员会主席团将审讯和诉讼整个控制在自己手里，包括指定对哪些事实进行侦讯、诉讼包括那些内容、审讯要达到什么结果以及确定怎样的惩罚措施。
<br><br>
以鲁金科为首成立了“封闭式”的“贝利亚事件”8人专门审判委员会。专门法庭指控贝利亚“犯有叛国罪，组织旨在攫取政权和建立资产阶级 统治的反苏阴谋团伙，实行对忠于党和人民的政治活动家的恐怖行动，积极反对1919年巴库的革命工人运动。贝利亚曾任阿塞拜疆反革命木沙瓦特派反谍报机关的秘密间谍，并同外国情报机关一直保持联系，直到他被揭露和逮捕。”[3]法庭还认为贝利亚是隐藏着的英、美、德等几个帝国主义国家的多重间谍，指控他在1942年任高加索前线最高统帅部代表时企图打开高加索山脉的山隘口，放希特勒军队进入格鲁吉亚。<br><br>

贝利亚在最后的庭审中为自己进行了申辩，但他的申辩已经不起丝毫作用，审讯只是一项程序，他的命运事实上早在审讯之前就已决定了。1953年12月23日，法庭最终以“叛卖祖国、组织反苏阴谋团伙以攫取政权，建立资产阶级国家，实行反对忠于党和人民的政治活动家的恐怖行动”的罪行判处贝利亚死刑。枪决于当晚立即执行。贝利亚被枪毙后，按中央主席团的命令，他保险柜里的文件立即被全部销毁。
<br><br>

<a href= "link02.html">卡廷惨案：苏联为何屠杀2万波兰精英</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic06.html">阿拉斯（Alaska ）加以前是俄罗斯的</a><br><br>

1953年3月―6月这段时间贝利亚的行为是矛盾的。他开始揭露斯大林的暴行，揭露惩罚机关的残酷，利用自己手中掌管的内务部机构搜集领导集团其他成员的材料，揭露他们对大清洗的参与，但是却故意忽略甚至抹煞自己曾经作为政治镇压的主要参加者的事实；他为几个著名案件平反，然而从案件的选择上不难看出其用意所在，在贝利亚被捕前的几个月，真正获得自由的受难者只是沧海一粟；他提出反对个人崇拜，努力摘下斯大林头上伟大、光荣、正确的光环，但却明显地带有个人目的；在经济上、在对匈牙利和德国的政策上，贝利亚的立场又表现出改革的倾向。如何评价贝利亚，是个复杂的问题。I・鲁宾在其新著《拉夫连季・贝利亚：神话与现实》的序言中提出：“当然，贝利亚绝不是天使，他所犯的罪行不比斯大林制度下任何一位知名的活动家少……(但)莫洛托夫、加里宁、马林科夫和卡冈诺维奇，甚至赫鲁晓夫，他们比贝利亚 更早地跻身于克里姆林宫的奥林帕斯山上，难道他们在这种残暴的制度下的罪孽就少些吗?”[4]在随着斯大林之死恐怖年代行将逝去的时候，在众多的权力觊觎者中间独独贝利亚被消灭了，其根本原因是贝利亚手中掌握着几十年来从事犯罪和血腥镇压的恐怖机构以及能够致中央委员会主席团成员于死地的专案文件。<br><br>

贝利亚的覆灭结束了斯大林死后苏共党内权力斗争的第一个阶段，赫鲁晓夫取得了绝对的优势，他在党的领导集团中的地位得到确认。
<br><br>
贝利亚被以不合法律程序的方式消灭了，但这并不意味着又回到了不要法制的年代。贝利亚在 斯大林死后的行为在很大程度上是争夺权力的斗争，但在客观上也开启了反斯大林化和大规模政治平反的序幕，而贝利亚的死才标志着斯大林时代的真正结束和国家政治生活的真正转折。<br><br>

【摘要】托洛茨基其人备受物议，但他无疑是个革命家，在苏俄历史上发挥过重要作用。他参与领导了俄国1905年革命和1917年的十月革命，建立红军并取得国内战争的胜利。他是最早揭露和批判斯大林错误的人物。在总结苏共丧权、苏联解体的教训中，托洛茨基当年的一些评论颇值得注意。<br><br>

<br><br>
在国际共产主义运动史上至少有两个人是迄今没有得到盖棺定论的，他们作为对立 的矛盾体，生时不共戴天，死后也未得到公认的论定。这就是托洛茨基和斯大林。<br><br>

托洛茨基其人对中国人来说并不陌生。在上世纪20年代初，他曾被当作俄国革命的领袖介绍给中国，那时候，托洛茨基和列宁是并提的，其情景有如中国朱毛并提一样。托洛茨基有关文学艺术的论述对我国进步的文艺界有过很大的影响，鲁迅案头就有他的《文学和革命》。后来在联共党内斗争中托洛茨基失败并被驱逐出境，在苏联30年代的大清洗浪潮中举行了三次大公审，每次都同托洛茨基挂上了钩，托洛茨基的名字就直接等同于反革命了。中国有一批留学莫斯科的学生，在中国革命问题上反对斯大林的 方针，赞同托洛茨基的主张，这些人成了中国的托派分子。本来这是革命方针路线方法的分歧，但那时康生给他们加上接受日本帝国主义津贴的罪名，中国的托派成了日本的特务。这样一来，无论中国的、外国的托派就统统成了帝国主义的走狗、代理人了。在国际共产主义运动中，一旦发生分歧和争论，最简便的办法之一就是指责对方为“托派”。赫鲁晓夫当年就想给中国戴这顶帽子。<br><br>

一个政治人物、政治流派变成了一个政治术语或一顶“政治帽子”的时候，人们对其真正内涵倒不甚关心，反正信手拈来，随手抛出，就可以“克敌致胜”。托洛茨基到 底何许人?他的真正观点是什么?如果他有错误的话，他的真正错误又何在?对诸如此类的问题，已经很少有人能说得清。苏联和俄国是托洛茨基的故乡，那里对托洛茨基批得最厉害，在二三十年代苏联出现的任何问题、任何错误都可以甚至必须同托洛茨基的名字联系在一起。然而他们的学者看不到托洛茨基的著作，如果要批托洛茨基和托洛茨基主义，只能根据党的文件规定的调子和文件中介绍或引证的托洛茨基的言论开展批判。当然这些经过精心剪裁、挑选的东西是很难展示托洛茨基的本来思想的。从20年代起，苏联批判托洛茨基的专著多如牛毛，然而有多少经得起岁月考验，站得住脚，就难说了。正因为如此，在戈尔巴乔夫统治的后期和苏联解体之后，苏俄出版了一批托洛茨基著作和论述托洛茨基的著作，这也是“填补历史空白”的一项重要内容。
<br><br>
我国在解放前出版过不少托洛茨基的著作。在20年代他的著作是当作革命读物在我国传播的，如1921年广州人民出版社出的《俄国革命记实》(即《从十月革命到布列斯特和约》)， 1922年广州人民出版社出的《多数党与世界和平》(即《战争与国际》)、《共产主义和恐怖主义》， 1928年北京未名社出的《文学与革命》等等。进入30年代则主要是由托派人士翻译出版，仅《托洛茨基自传》就出过译自不同文字的三四种不同的版本，托洛茨基的三卷本《俄国革命史》有翻译质量不错的王凡西和郑超麟的译本(春燕出版社1941―1948年版)。
<br><br>
解放后，“为研究苏联过渡时期的阶级斗争”，中国人民大学在1958年出版了两卷本的《苏联托洛茨基布哈林反革命言论选集》，作为“党内参考”，收集的主要是发表在《真理报》上的文章。这是解放后中国最早出版的托洛茨基和布哈林言论集。在60年代的中苏争论中，苏方有意给中国戴“托洛茨基主义”的帽子，逼得中国领导人去了解什么是托洛茨基主义。当时翻译出版了一批托洛茨基的重要著作，其中有《俄国局势真相》、《列宁以后的共产国际》、《不断革命论》、《被背叛的革命》、《斯大林评传》，等等。这些书能看到的人不多，但能出版这么一批托洛茨基的原著，怎么说都是一件好事。粉碎“四人帮”之后，还出版了两卷本的《托洛茨基言论》，虽然也是内部发行，但范围大多了。前言和按语基本上是沿袭过去的调子，许多论断是站不住脚的，但毕竟为广大研究人员提供了能反映托洛茨基基本观点的材料，至少是受到斯大林批判的那些观点的原始材料。1992年外国文学出版社公开出版了托洛茨基的《文学与革命》的全译本， 2007年上海人民出版社出版了赵泓、田娟玉译，郑异凡校的《我的生平》。应该说，这是一种好现象。要研究历史，就得拥有相应的资料，这是学术研究最起码的要求。1990年我曾参加在德国召开的一个托洛茨基问题国际学术会议，会上西方的一学者声言，苏联和中国的学者连托洛茨基的著作都看不到，还谈得上什么研究。当时的苏联，确实除少数像沃尔科戈诺夫那样的学者能进入机密档案库外，多数人还看不到托洛茨基的著作和档案。好在我倒是可以在会上介绍在中国出版的托洛茨基著作以及中央编译局图书馆馆藏的各种文字的托洛茨基著作的情况。
<br><br>
由于众所周知的原因，关于托洛茨基的研究在我国可以说还处于起步阶段。1980年代我国有一些零星的评论文章见诸报刊，对托洛茨基的某些功过提出新的看法。1986年社会科学出版社出版了李显荣的《托洛茨基评传》，这是我国建国以来第一部托洛茨基的传记著作，提供了关于托洛茨基的大量资料，但由于明显的原因，书中传多评少，对托洛茨基的重新评价只起了一个头。
<br><br>
对国际共产主义运动起过重大作用的这样一个历史人物，是不能仅仅用“反革命托派头子”、“托洛茨基主义创始人”、“列宁主义的死敌”、“外国帝国主义的走狗”甚至 “间谍”这样的帽子来概括的。托洛茨基是个复杂的历史人物，对他的评价不管是好是坏，都必须根据实际材料，作出较为客观的较为接近实际的评价。尤其是在苏联解体后的今天，我们要认识苏联解体、苏共垮台的原因，更不能不去研究这个列宁的战友、斯大林的死对头的托洛茨基的理论观点和他所主张的方针政策，以及他当年对苏联社会的分析。

托洛茨基，原姓勃朗施坦，全名是列夫・达维多维奇・勃朗施坦， 1879年生于南俄草原的一个富农家庭。19世纪90年代开始参加工人运动。按照苏共的习惯，在俄国社 会民主工党成立之前，参加革命组织的年份即算作参加俄国社会民主工党的时间，因此在十月革命后的早期出版物上，托洛茨基入党的年份是1896年，即他组织南俄工人同盟的时候。只是后来为了表明托洛茨基不是正宗的布尔什维克党员，才把他的入党时间改写为1917年，即从他与“区联派”一起同布尔什维克党合并时算起。<br><br>

在同盟活动了两年， 1898年被捕入狱，被判处流放西伯利亚四年。1902年秋从西伯利亚逃脱，其假护照署名“托洛茨基”，结果弄假成真，以后反而以此名著称。在伦敦第一次见到列宁，继而开始用笔名“笔尖”为《火星报》撰稿。列宁对这个年轻人评价甚高，不久即推荐他为《火星报》第七名编委。1903年3月2日列宁给普列汉诺夫写信，建议增补托洛茨基为编辑部“享有一切平等权利的成员”，说他正干劲十足地为《火星报》工作和作报告，并且取得了很大成绩；对于时事述评专栏来说，托洛茨基不但十分有用，而且“简直是不可缺少的”；“毫无疑问，他是一个才华出众的人，一个有信念、有干劲的人，这个人是有发展前途的。”[1]这个建议由于普列汉诺夫的反对没有通过，但托洛茨基开始列席编辑部的会议，没有表决权。同年7-8月，托洛茨基以西伯利亚代表的身份出席在布鲁塞尔和伦敦召开的俄国社会民主工党第二次代表大会。起初他是列宁派的主力成员，有人甚至把他叫做“列宁的棍子”。不久会议在组织问题上出现不同的意见，托洛茨基属少数派，即孟什维克。托洛茨基在会上的发言有两点值得注意。1・他认为，“无产阶级专政不是秘密工作者‘夺取政权’，而是构成民族多数的有组织的工人阶级的政治统治”，因此“只有社会主义者获得多数时，无产阶级专政的时代才会到来”。这不是什么独创的新观点，而是传统的社会主义观念。2・他在反对列宁的党章条文时提出一个论据：仅仅靠规章制度不足以防止机会主义。“机会主义是由更为复杂的原因造成的”，“它是由资产阶级民主和无产阶级的相对发展水平、由前者对后者的影响及其他的复杂原因所引起的”[2]。这个提法本身在原则上是正确的。然而，在当时俄国小组习气十分严重、组织涣散的情况下，托洛茨基没有看到一个严整的组织的重要性，没有看到在当时沙皇制度的残酷镇压下，一个有铁的纪律的严密的组织对无产阶级革命和夺取政权的决定性意义。<br><br>

托洛茨基在孟什维克阵营里的时间并不长， 1904年9月正式宣布退出孟什维克派，从此他游离于孟什维克和布尔什维克之间。
<br><br>
1905年革命爆发之后，托洛茨基于2月回到俄国，参加了轰轰烈烈的革命。这一年出版了由帕尔乌斯作序的他的小册子《一月九日以前》，提出了不断革命的概念。在革命中诞生了俄国特有的组织形式――苏维埃，彼得堡的苏维埃在1905年的革命中发挥了重大的作用。12月彼得堡苏维埃主席赫鲁斯塔廖夫-诺萨尔被捕，托洛茨基接任了几天彼得堡苏维埃主席的职务，很快也被捕了。在狱中写作《总结与展望》，出版文集《我们的革命》，论证他的不断革命论。1906年9月被判处长期流放， 1907年2月在流放途中逃脱。4月，以梯弗利斯代表的身份出席在伦敦召开的俄国社会民主工党第五次代表大会。1907年起定居维也纳，次年创办俄文报纸《真理报》，这是后来举世闻名 的《真理报》的前身。从1912年决定把这份报纸收编为党报这一事实，可以看出托洛茨基的这份报纸办得不错，是受到欢迎的。<br><br>

1905年革命失败之后，托洛茨基大体上做了两件事。一是总结革命的教训，分析俄国革命的动力，阶级力量对比，革命的可能发展前景，阐发他的不断革命论；二是在当时党内布尔什维克和孟什维克对立日益严重的情况下做两派的和解工作，这就是托洛茨基“调和主义”的来源。列宁对托洛茨基的“调和主义”进行了猛烈的抨击。二月革命前列宁和托洛茨基争论得最激烈的就是这个组织问题。列宁批判托洛茨基的文章，数 量最多的也是这个问题。对自己所从事的这两项工作，十月革命后托洛茨基本人认为，他关于俄国革命的动力、前景等等的估计是完全正确的，得到了历史的证实，但他所进行的调和工作，则是错误的。<br><br>

1912年1月俄国社会民主工党在布拉格召开第六次代表会议，这个会议基本上是布尔什维克一派的代表会议。会上决定把取消派开除出党。需要注意的是，开除的是孟什维克取消派，而不是孟什维克，这就是说，这以后布尔什维克和孟什维克两派，还有托洛茨基，仍然共处于一个党之内。由于在这次会议之后斯大林被补选为中央委员，所以苏联的党史著作把布拉格代表会议的地位大大抬高，甚至说是布尔什维克形成独立政党的开始。实际上，这以后无论布尔什维克，还是孟什维克，都用俄国社会民主工党的名称，至于作为区别在后面加上“(布)”的字样，那是1917年二月革命以后的事。<br><br>

1912年巴尔干战争爆发。托洛茨基应《基辅思想报》之约任该报在巴尔干的战地记者。这段战地记者生涯使托洛茨基受益无穷，十月革命后他组织红军，领兵作战，这段时间观察战争的经历给他提供了重要的借鉴。<br><br>

1914年， 20世纪人类第一个大劫难――第一次世界大战爆发。对待战争，托洛茨 基持国际主义立场，这使他同布尔什维克有了共同语言。他是1915年在齐美瓦尔德召开的国际社会党人第一次代表会议的参加者，是会议总宣言的起草者。大战期间，托洛茨基同其他俄国流亡的革命者一样过着颠沛流离的生活，从维也纳移居苏黎世、巴黎，最后被法国驱逐出境， 1916年11月经西班牙赴纽约。在纽约，他在俄国侨民中间进行革命宣传工作，参加了《新世界报》的工作，使该报转向国际主义立场。托洛茨基认为，他在该报发表的文章同列宁回国前所发表的关于俄国革命的观点是吻合的。后到的布哈林曾与他同事于该报，两人的关系很不错，有共同语言――都主张在俄国立即进行社会主义革命。
<br><br>
1917年获悉俄国二月革命的消息之后，托洛茨基立即动身回国。但回国的道路并不平坦， 4月初被英国当局逮捕，直到4月底才获释返俄，到彼得格勒已经是5月了。由于1905年的声望，他立即成为彼得格勒苏维埃执行委员会委员。他加入了在大战期间就存在的国际派组织“区联派”，主张区联派同布尔什维克统一。在7月召开的俄国社会民主工党第六次代表大会上，实现了布尔什维克党与区联派的统一。这是统一合并，而不是区联派加入布尔什维克党。所以严格讲，托洛茨基不是加入布尔什维克党，而是通过两派合并成为其成员的。由于在7月事变后托洛茨基被临时政府逮捕，所以他没能参加党的六大，是缺席当选党的中央委员的。9月初获释出狱，立即当选彼得格勒苏维埃主席，这是苏维埃倒向布尔什维克的重要标志。<br><br>

从二月革命以来，党内在一系列重大问题上始终存在不同意见。首先，列宁主张立即从民主革命转向社会主义革命，这受到以加米涅夫为代表的“老布尔什维克”的反对，他们认为俄国民主革命尚未完成，不能把社会主义革命立即提上日程。其次，列宁主张对临时政府持不信任、不支持的立场，而加米涅夫和斯大林等却在《真理报》上宣传“有条件地支持临时政府”的主张。到了9月份，列宁认为俄国的政治危机已经成熟，应当立即准备武装起义。这不仅受到季诺维也夫和加米涅夫的直接反对，而且在中央委员会里也得不到支持，对列宁建议不予理睬，逼得列宁以退出中央委员会相威胁。然而，在这些根本问题上列宁却得到了托洛茨基的支持。托洛茨基本来就主张用社会主义革命去解决民主革命的任务，因此，对列宁在二月革命后提出的社会主义革命的方针可以说是一拍即合。托洛茨基领导的彼得格勒苏维埃成立了军事革命委员会，这是第一个革命战斗司令部，在组织十月革命武装起义工作中发挥了决定性作用。一年后，斯大林在纪念十月革命一周年的文章中说，“起义的全部实际组织工作是在彼得格勒苏维埃主席托洛茨基同志直接领导下进行的。可以坚定地说，无产阶级很快转到苏维埃方面来与军事革命委员会善于做日常工作是分不开的，这些方面党首先并主要应该归功于托洛茨基。”[3]1917年10月25日，宣告临时政府被推翻的苏维埃政权的第一个文告《告俄国公民书》，就是以“彼得格勒工兵代表苏维埃军事革命委员会”的名义发布的。文告宣布：“国家政权业已转到彼得格勒工兵代表苏维埃机关，即领导彼得格勒无产阶级和卫戍部队的军事革命委员会。”[4]由此不难看出军事革命委员会在十月革命中的份量。<br><br>

至于说当时存在一个“从政治上领导起义的政治局”，这是一个不合逻辑的机构。众所周知，在武装起义前夕，季诺维也夫和加米涅夫两人是坚决反对起义的，在10月10日和16日的两次中央会议上都投票反对起义，后来加米涅夫还在《新生活报》上发表短文，反对起义。但奇怪的是，这样两个人竟然是“从政治上领导起义的政治局”委员!他们究竟是从政治上领导，还是从政治上反对起义呢?显然，任何一个革命组织都不可能作出如此不合逻辑的决定，何况不把起义问题当儿戏的布尔什维克党。<br><br>

据斯大林秘书托夫斯图哈在30年代初揭露，原来这个“政治局”是1924年在反托洛茨基斗争的高潮中斯大林在会议记录上添加进去的，也就是说，是斯大林在1924年“组建”的!在十月革命中并不存在什么“政治局”。<br><br>

十月革命胜利后，托洛茨基出任第一届苏维埃政府的外交人民委员。摆在他面前的第一件大事就是苏维埃政权如何实现“和平”的许诺。在协约国拒绝和平建议的情况下，列宁决定同德国单独谈判，谋求和平。12月，托洛茨基接替越飞任苏俄和谈代表团首席代表。托洛茨基的基本思想是利用谈判进行革命宣传，拖住德国以待其国内革命的发展。对这个方针起初列宁是支持的。列宁在俄共七大上说：
<br><br>
“我要谈一谈托洛茨基同志的立场。应该把他的活动的两个方面区别开来：当他开始在布列斯特进行谈判，并且出色地利用了这次谈判来进行宣传的时候，我们大家都同意托洛茨基同志的做法。……托洛茨基的策略要拖延谈判这一点是正确的，但宣布战争状态已经结束而又不签订和约，那就不正确了。”[5]
<br><br>
按照列宁的看法，托洛茨基的基本错误是在德国人提出最后通牒的时候不应该宣布“不战不和”，而应当签署屈辱的和约。当时托洛茨基的想法是，一个革命政权，不能不作最后的抵抗就签署屈辱的和约，要让全世界看到，苏维埃政权是在敌人刺刀的逼迫下 签署和约的，这就会激起西方无产阶级起来造他们本国政府的反。他估计，只要德国军队向苏维埃国家发起进攻，德国无产阶级就会采取行动去推翻资产阶级政府。然而，他的估计并没有得到证实。拒不签署的结果是苏维埃政权不得不签署更加苛刻的条约。
<br><br>
一直流行一种说法，称托洛茨基的行为“违背了列宁的指示”。实际上这里谈不上“指示”，因为列宁的主和观点在相当长的时间里在中央处于少数，如果按照中央的精神来衡量，托洛茨基并没有错。所以列宁说，“当时我们之间曾经约定：德国人不下最后通牒，我们就坚持下去，等他们下了最后通牒我们就让步。”[6]列宁这里说的是“约定”，而不是“决定”或者“指示”。其次，历来都把托洛茨基算作反对布列斯特和约的罪魁祸首。其实，坚持反对签订布列斯特和约的是以布哈林为首的左派共产主义者集团。托洛茨基在紧要关头的态度有所不同。1918年2月23日在德军再次提出最后通牒之后，党中央召开会议，讨论对策。在表决列宁的提案“是否立即接受德国的建议”时，提案以7票赞成， 4票反对， 4票弃权得到通过。在这里投弃权票的是托洛茨基及其支持者。当时与会者共19人，有表决权的是15人。如果托洛茨基派投反对票，列宁的主张就会以7对8票被否决，所以托洛茨基派的弃权起了决定性的作用。托洛茨基本人解释说，他之所以弃权，是因为必须找到摆脱既成局面的出路：唯一的出路就是不妨碍形成接受统一路线的多数。实际上，有一段时间，不仅左派共产主义者接受不战不和的路线，连斯大林也支持过这条路线。他在1918年1月19日的中央会议上说：“我们摆脱困境的出路是中间观点――托洛茨基的立场。”在2月23日的会议上又说：“可以不签订(和约)，但开始和谈。”[7]从这里也可以看出，为什么列宁的主张在相当一段时间里一直处于少数。
<br><br>
在分歧中各派有一个共同的期待，这就是世界革命，都指望世界革命，特别是德国 爆发革命来支持俄国。问题是对世界革命、德国革命爆发的时间的估计。托洛茨基、布哈林等的估计是几天之内革命就会爆发，而列宁认为不是几天，而是几个月。这是一百步和五十步的差别。对世界革命速度的估计不同，采取的方针政策也就不同，带来的后果就更加不同了。这里根本不存在出卖革命，充当德国帝国主义的帮凶的问题。无论是主和的列宁，主战的布哈林，还是主张不战不和的托洛茨基，他们都是世界革命论者!在这一点上他们是同志，是志同道合者。所以尽管争论极其激烈，但党并没有分裂，争论过去之后，大家依然同舟共济。
<br><br>
和约签订后， 1918年3月，托洛茨基辞去外交人民委员职务，任最高军事委员会主席， 9月，共和国革命军事委员会成立，托继续任主席。在整个国内战争期间托洛茨基基本上是在战场上度过的。当时有一个非常出名的“托洛茨基专列”，这就是他的办公室。他组建了一支最后战胜外国干涉军和国内白军的红军，在战争过程中他大胆倡议使用旧军事专家，反对游击作风，保证了红军的胜利。可以说，在三年战争中，哪个战场有问题，他就出现在哪里。高尔基在《列宁》一书中曾这样记述列宁对托洛茨基的评价：“‘是的，是的，我知道!关于我和他的关系有人在胡说。谎话太多了，特别是关于我和托洛茨基之间的关系。’他拍了一下桌子说：‘请您给我指出另一位能够在一年里组织一个几乎是模范的军队并取得军事专家尊敬的人来，我们已经有了这样的人!’。”[8]
<br><br>
建立一支正规红军，使用旧俄军事专家，是托洛茨基的在国内战争中的功绩之一。我们在《联共(布)党史简明教程》中可以看到，在党的八大前后有一个以伏罗希洛夫为代表的“军事反对派”。《简明教程》对各种反对派向来是毫不留情的，但对“军事反对派”却写得颇为含情。书中充分肯定了他们反对托洛茨基的活动，然后才轻描淡写地说，“这个派别维护军队中的游击主义残余，反对建立正规红军，反对利用军事专家，反对铁的纪律”。然而，他们反对的这些东西恰恰是托洛茨基所创造所坚持的，是保证苏维埃政权在战争中胜利的必不可少的东西。《简明教程》说，“列宁和斯大林坚决地反对了‘军事反对派’”。然而，军事反对派的后台不是别人，正是斯大林。国内战争期间在军事反对派等问题上的分歧和斗争，埋下了以后斯大林和托洛茨基长期不和的种子。
<br><br>
在国内战争期间，为了及时解决迫切问题，在中央委员会内成立了一个四人小组，其成员是列宁、斯维尔德洛夫、托洛茨基和斯大林。由于托洛茨基经常在前线，所以在莫斯科处理迫切问题和日常事务的就是三人了。这是政治局的前身。1919年12月召开党的第八次代表会议通过的党章正式决定设立政治局，负责政治工作，托洛茨基是政治局委员。<br><br>

在国内战争临近结束的时候有两件事值得注意。<br><br>

其一是1919年冬托洛茨基到乌拉尔指导经济工作，其成果是1920年2月向中央提出的《粮食和土地政策的基本问题》提纲。托洛茨基指出，粮食征收制(又译“余粮收集制”)等政策正在降低农业生产，造成工业无产阶级的涣散，并且有使全国经济生活彻底瓦解的危险。因此他建议： 1・用按产量比例征税的办法代替粮食征收制(一种累计所得税)。2・严格确定供给农民的工业品和农民交纳的粮食量的相互关系，用工业品换取农民的粮食和原料。不难看出，这就是后来实行的以粮食税为标志的新经济政策的思路。但是，当时的多数领导人还没有认识到这一点，建议在政治局会议上被否决了。要再等一年的时间加上喀琅施塔特暴动的逼迫，中央的多数才能认识到改行粮食税的迫切性和必要性。
<br><br>
其二是关于工会问题的争论。乌拉尔考察之后， 1920年托洛茨基回到莫斯科，负责恢复交通运输工作。当时机车损坏，燃料缺乏，劳动纪律涣散，全国的铁路运输处于瘫痪状态。托洛茨基接手交通工作之后，采取军事手段，很快取得了成效。这使他看到军事手段在恢复工业中可以发挥重大的作用。因此，他于11月向中央全会提出《工会及其今后任务》的提纲初稿。由此引发了一场工会问题争论。
<br><br>
工会问题的提出，根本原因是无产阶级政权的建立。在无产阶级革命胜利以前，工会的主要任务是领导广大工人进行政治和经济斗争，保护工人的利益，与此同时，工会也是掩护工人政党从事革命工作的合法机构。在无产阶级革命胜利以后，无产阶级执掌了政权，工会似乎已经失去领导工人进行政治经济斗争的任务，维护工人利益的任务已经完成。这就出现一个新问题：工会的任务是什么?这是个新课题。在苏维埃政权建立的初期，工会曾直接领导经济，因此在十月革命以后就出现工会领导经济建设的提法。无产阶级文化派提得最明确：党领导政治，工会领导经济，无产阶级文化协会领导文化。党的八大通过的党纲中说：“工会应当做到把作为统一经济整体的全部国民经济的全部管理切实地集中在自己的手中。”[9]后来成立了最高国民经济委员会，工会同它一起领导经济工作。再后来，由于各种经济机关陆续建立，国民经济工作逐渐由这些经济 机关实施领导，这样工会就不知道自己应当去干什么了。正式的提法是工会同经济机关的“结合”，所以有“工会国家化”的口号。这个口号在党的十大的决议中也没有予以否定，那里否定的只是“迅速使工会国家化”，“人为地加快工会国家化的速度”。决议指出：“现在工会也已经在执行着某些完全属于国家机关的职能(规定工资等级，分配工作服，等等)。在苏维埃国家里，工会的这些国家性质的职能还会逐渐扩大。”[10]<br><br>

在工会问题上列宁对托洛茨基的主要指责是他关于“整刷”(直译是“抖搂”)工会的提法。托洛茨基认为，工会出现了危机，解决危机的办法是从上而下地对工会进行 “整刷”，把不合格的工会干部“抖搂”掉。他的矛头是针对当时被他看作是工会“保守派”的托姆斯基等人的。这自然引起列宁的不安，他担心由此引起党和工会的分裂。
<br><br>
在苏维埃政权之下，工会到底应当起什么作用呢?列宁的提法是：工会是共产主义的学校。托洛茨基的提法是工会应当突出“生产观点”即抓经济工作。在两者争得不可开交的时候，布哈林出来打圆场，搞“缓冲”和“折中”，说“一方面，它们(工会)是共产主义的学校……另一方面，它们又是――并且越来越是――经济机关和整个国家机关的一个组成部分”。如果从俄共的文献看，确实两种职能、两种提法都是存在的。工会的国家化被看作是一种不可避免的发展趋势。<br><br>

当时的工会还有一种功能在整个争论过程中被忽视了，至少没有引起足够的重视，这就是保护工人的利益。梁赞诺夫曾提出，工会应当仍然作为联合工人以保护或捍卫他们的物质利益和精神利益的组织。当然，不是用罢工的方法。托洛茨基反对这一提法，认为这是“苏维埃工联主义”。列宁认为托洛茨基的看法是错误的，他说，当时的苏维埃国家是“带有官僚主义弊病的工人国家”。因此“组织起来的无产阶级应当保护自己，而我们则应当利用这些工人组织来保护工人免受自己国家的侵犯，同时也利用这些组织 来组织工人保护我们的国家”[11]。但是，列宁的这一提法完全淹没在形形色色的纲领之中，没有引起任何一派的注意。我们看到，随着苏维埃国家官僚化的发展，随着个人独裁的加剧，列宁所指出的工会的这一保护任务越来越具有重大的意义。还有一点是当时还感觉不到的，这就是由于实行新经济政策，国内出现多种经济成分，私人资本主义得到某种程度的发展，这样，保护在私人企业工作的工人的利益，使工会具有资本主义国家的工会的同样的意义。这一点是在夺得政权时所没有想到的。可惜的是，列宁有关保 护工人利益的论点在苏联的实践中，在工会理论著作中都没有引起重视。关于1921年工会问题的争论，人们看到的仅仅是列宁反对托洛茨基和布哈林的斗争，是反对派别活动的斗争。热闹异常的工会问题争论，实际上并没有完全回答苏俄工会的任务问题。<br><br>

工会问题的争论在党内引发了大量的派别，它们各有各的纲领。最后，连列宁本人也加入了“十人纲领”派。这种派别林立，就某一问题展开广泛争论的现象，严重妨碍了日常工作，妨碍把工作重心转向经济工作，而派别的存在直接威胁到党的统一。鉴于此，俄共第十次代表大会通过关于党的统一的决议，禁止一切派别和派别活动。决议中 的第七条规定，把从事派别活动的中央委员开除出中央委员会。这一条当时没有公布，这是考虑到这是一项临时措施，希望备而不用。然而这一条规定后来却成了斯大林打击异己的一根大棒，大量中央委员以至政治局委员，稍有不同意见，就在“派别活动”的罪名下被开除出党。其实，十大还通过一个关于党的建设的决议，规定在党内生活中实行“工人民主制”，要求废除任命制，实行各级干部的选举制，定期报告工作制，等等。但由于党的主要领导对党的决定采取了为我所用的态度，关于实行工人民主制的决定从来就没有得到贯彻执行。<br><br>

国内战争末期，农民纷纷举行起义反对军事共产主义制度，特别是粮食征收制。党的十大召开期间，发生了喀琅施塔特水兵暴动。水兵们的行动表达了广大农民对粮食征收制的不满，工农联盟面临破裂的危险，年轻的苏维埃国家面临严重的政治经济危机。暴动虽然用武力镇压下去了，但问题没有解决。于是一年前被否决的托洛茨基的建议，又旧事重提了。党的十大决定中止军事共产主义，放弃粮食征收制，改行粮食税。这是新经济政策的开始，是历史上第一次社会主义建设模式的更换。一般的概念，托洛茨基是新经济政策的反对者，然而事实并非如此。托洛茨基关于新经济政策的论述曾经被看 作是代表党的观点的文件。1922年11月14日，列宁在《致北美俄国侨民》中写道：“凡对我们的新经济政策这个唯一正确的政策的问题还不够清楚的人，我都请他们读一读托洛茨基同志和我在共产国际第四次代表大会上有关这一问题的讲话。”[12]11月25日，列宁给托洛茨基去信说：“读了您论述新经济政策的提纲，我认为总的来说写得很好，某些提法恰到好处，但有少数几点我觉得还值得商榷。我建议暂时先在报上发表，以后一定要再印成单行本出版，要是再加上一些说明，那对于向国外公众介绍我国的新 经济政策将是特别合适的。”[13]列宁的这两段评语是可以说明问题的。
<br><br>
从1921年底起，列宁的健康状况开始恶化，不得不断断续续地去休养。1922年3―4月召开了党的第十一次代表大会，会后斯大林当选中央总书记。应当说，到这时候为止斯大林是得到列宁信任的。然而到了这一年的下半年，事情发生了根本性的变化。由于列宁不能经常视事，斯大林在处理一些重大问题上出现了明显的不同于列宁的偏向。在成立联盟国家问题上，斯大林主张各民族共和国以自治共和国的形式加入俄罗斯联邦，是谓“自治化”方案。为贯彻这一方案，斯大林对某些持异议的共和国领导人 实行高压政策。“自治化”方案受到列宁的批评。斯大林虽然接受了列宁提出的所有共和国，包括俄罗斯联邦在内，一律加入新建的联盟的建议，但心中并不服气，把气撒在反对“自治化”最激烈的格鲁吉亚共产党的领导人身上，把格鲁吉亚等国降为自治共和国，要它们通过外高加索联邦加入新的共和国联盟，从而激化了同格鲁吉亚党政领导的矛盾。其次是弱化对外贸易垄断。由于实行了新经济政策，斯大林等一部分中央委员主张削弱对外贸易的垄断。而列宁认为在资本主义国家的包围下，在新经济政策条件下，不能削弱外贸垄断。由于在十月中央全会上，已作出不利于外贸垄断的决定，列宁要求 在下次全会之前暂缓执行决定，由下次全会重新研究这一问题。第三，是官僚主义泛滥，列宁认为曾由斯大林领导的负责反对官僚主义的工农检察院工作不力，有负使命。
<br><br>
在以上三个问题上，列宁都处于少数地位。为维护自己的立场，列宁多次求助于与自己观点一致的托洛茨基，委托托洛茨基在全会和党的代表大会上代表自己发言。1922年12月15日，列宁在给托洛茨基的信中说：“请您在全会上声明我们两人意见一致。”[14]同日，列宁在给中央委员的信中说：他已同托洛茨基谈妥，“由他来维护我在对 外贸易垄断问题上的观点”，“我相信，托洛茨基维护我的观点，一点也不比我差”[15]。列宁的主张取得了最后的胜利。12月21日，列宁向克鲁普斯卡娅口授一封给托洛茨基的便条，要他在对外贸易垄断问题上“继续进攻”，为此克鲁普斯卡娅受到斯大林的辱骂。关于格鲁吉亚问题，列宁在1923年3月5日给托洛茨基写信，要他在党中央为格鲁吉亚人辩护，说“如果您同意出面为这件事辩护，那我就放心了”[16]。列宁在最后时日同托洛茨基的一致是有据可查的事实。相反地，列宁同斯大林的分歧则在逐步扩大，终于导致列宁建议中央设法解除斯大林总书记的职务，并最后给斯大林写信，提出“断绝我们之间的关系”的问题[17]。关于反对官僚主义，据托洛茨基本人的说法，列宁曾建议托洛茨基，两人组成反官僚主义的“联盟”。
<br><br>
在历史上托洛茨基确实同列宁有过分歧，但从二月革命以来两人的合作和一致大大超过分歧，到列宁的最后时日，托洛茨基成了列宁所能委托的唯一辩护人。由此可见，把托洛茨基说成一贯反对列宁，是列宁主义的死敌是缺乏事实根据的。
<br><br>
托洛茨基并没有利用列宁给予的托付去谋求自身的好处。在民族问题上托洛茨基行动不力，没有坚决站出来维护列宁的立场，而是采取了息事宁人、妥协让步的态度。他反对列宁所建议的处分在格鲁吉亚问题上负有责任的奥尔忠尼启则等人，反对撤消斯大林的总书记职务。在党的十二大上，在民族问题上他对列宁立场的维护还赶不上布哈林。如果从争权的角度看，托洛茨基显然坐失了利用列宁委托的良机。列宁从1923年3月中旬起已完全中止了政治生活，托洛茨基执行列宁委托不力，这就使斯大林有时间来扩大自己的势力，同季诺维也夫和加米涅夫组成“三驾马车”来控制局面。<br><br>

1923年4月，托洛茨基在为俄共十二大准备的关于工业的提纲中专门谈到计划工作的任务和方法。他指出，由于基本生产资料属国家所有，因此“国家对经济生活的积极干预必然具有计划的性质”。“社会主义经济的计划不能先验地通过理论途径或官僚主义途径来确立。真正的社会主义经济计划囊括相互关联的一切部门和整个工业与农业的相互关系，只有在国有化的基础上长期进行准备性的经济试验，不断对各经济部门的工作努力加以实际协调以及正确统计成绩之后才有可能制定出这样的计划。”他认为，“计划原则在我国不局限于个别的托拉斯或辛迪加的范围，而扩展到整个工业。不仅如此，国家计划应包括工业与农业、金融业、运输业、内贸及外贸的相互关系。”他同时警告，由于采取市场的经济形式，“国家应向各个企业提供在市场上进行经营活动的必要自由，不要试图用行政意图去取代这一自由。”[18]得到十二大批准的这个报告提纲为计划经济作了论证。<br><br>

1923年秋俄共围绕“新方针”展开了一场激烈的争论。“新方针”的争论是以托洛茨基的系列文章《新方针》得名的。这场争论存在明显的个人权力争夺成分，但撇开这一点不论，可以说它在苏联共产党的历史上具有极其重要的位置。
<br><br>
苏俄从1921年开始实行新经济政策，利用商品市场进行社会主义建设，在经济上放得比较开，取得了比较好的效益。然而在政治民主化方面却几乎没有什么进展。本来，在实施新经济政策的同时，俄共第十次代表大会曾通过决议，要在全党实行“工人民主制”，取消在军事共产主义下实行的“战斗命令制”。十大还通过了禁止派别活动的决议。禁止派别活动是一把双刃剑，它固然能够防止派别活动，但也可以以此为借口压制党内不同意见，扼杀党内民主。问题就在于在实践上很难区别不同意见与派别活动的界限。尽管关于工人民主的决议规定要实行选举制，取消任命制，然而在实践上任命制有增无减。这种状况引起了党内一部分人的忧虑。托洛茨基及其拥护者对此提出了批评，要求政治局的多数派改变政策，反对官僚主义，实行党内民主。这是苏联共产党历史上最大的一次，也是最后一次为争取党内民主而展开的争论。
<br><br>
争论是1923年9月中央全会引发的。全会主要是讨论解决面临的迫切经济问题，但在会议末期突然提出了改组革命军事委员会的问题，决定派伏洛希罗夫、奥尔忠尼启则和斯大林参加委员会。提出这个问题的时间和选派的人员都不很恰当。伏洛希罗夫在国内战争期间是“军事反对派”的重要人物之一，奥尔忠尼启则是因民族问题上的错误列宁要给予处分又没有受到处分的人物，派这样的人去革命军事委员会，不仅是对托洛茨基的一种挑战，也是对列宁批评的一种否定。其次就时机而言，也显然欠妥。在列宁 卧病不能视事的情况下，暂时维持现状，保持党内稳定，是比较符合整体利益的。改组革命军事委员会的措施，显然打破了平衡。托洛茨基对此反应强烈，不等会议结束即退出会场以示抗议。这是1923年秋冬党内争论的直接导火线。<br><br>

10月8日托洛茨基写了一封给中央委员会的信，指责党内缺乏民主，党的机关官僚化，用任命制取代选举制；抗议国家安全机关插手党内事务；同时指出国内经济形势极端恶化，对经济没有任何领导，混乱来自上头。他特别指责中央全会决定改组革命军事委员会，认为关于革命军事委员会人员更迭的真正理由同正式宣布的毫不相干。接着， 46名党的著名活动家向中央政治局递交了一份声明，认为党在经济领域，特别是党内关系方面领导不当，要求“改变政治局多数派”的政策。签名者意见并不完全一致，不少人对声明的内容和措辞表示了不同程度的保留。声明上没有托洛茨基的签字。<br><br>

以斯大林为首的政治局多数立即采取措施予以反击，党内形势趋于紧张。经过第一轮交手之后，也许都感觉到需要达成某种妥协， 11月7日《真理报》发表了季诺维也夫受中央委托而写的文章《党的新任务》，呼吁活跃党内生活，“切实实行党内的工人民 主――加强党内在一般政治问题、经济问题以及其他问题上的自由讨论”。季诺维也夫此文的某些提法同托洛茨基和46人声明中的说法差别不大。《真理报》在发表季诺维也夫文章时加了编者按，宣布就文章提出的问题展开全党争论。
<br><br>
争论进行了一个月左右， 12月5日中央政治局和中央监委主席团联席会议通过了《关于党的建设的决议》[19]。决议是一致通过的。同季诺维也夫的文章一样，决议中也有不少提法非常接近于托洛茨基等人的说法，有人甚至认为，决议出自托洛茨基的手笔，至少可以认为是双方妥协的结果。决议谈到了新经济政策条件下发生蜕化的危险，强调 贯彻工人民主制的必要性，“全体党员有公开讨论党的生活中一切重要问题的自由，有对这些问题展开争论的自由，同时由下而上的各级领导人员和集体领导机构都应由选举产生”；“党的领导机关必须倾听广大党员群众的呼声，不要把任何批评都视为派别活动的表现，不要因此把忠诚的守纪律的党员推上派别活动的道路”。决议还要求“经常批判地研究自己的过去，纠正自己的错误，集体讨论最重要的问题”；认为只有采用这样的工作方法，才能保证偶然的意见分歧不致形成派别集团。这些说法是比较实事求是的，也切中时弊。<br><br>

季诺维也夫的文章和《关于党的建设的决议》被看作是实行“新方针”的开始。<br><br>

12月8日托洛茨基给党的会议写了一封题为《新方针》的信。他高度评价《关于党的建设的决议》，认为“它标志着党在自己的历史道路上着手作重大的转变”。接着他抨击了党的机关和官僚主义，谈了新老两代人的关系和派别活动等问题，指出“只有发展、加强和巩固工人民主这一方针”，才能消除派别活动的危险。接着又在《真理报》上连续发表以《新方针》为总标题的一组文章，包括《小集团和派别组织的形成》、《关于党内新老两代的问题》、《党的社会成分》，这些文章，再加上以后撰写的几篇东西，于1924年1月结成一个小册子，以《新方针》为书名出版。<br><br>

“新方针”的争论涉及两方面的问题：一个是党内生活问题，一个是经济政策问题。
<br><br>
关于党内生活，主要是党内民主或工人民主问题，是这次争论中的一个重要问题。如果细心对照一下，除去个别激烈的、过火的用词不论，那么双方的论点和主张表面上差别并不大，有些基本提法颇为相近。
<br><br>
托洛茨基一方认为，党内生活中的最大问题是缺乏民主，没有自由讨论的风气。党章规定的党的各级组织的选举制没有得到执行，上级任命制取代了选举制，结果“党的机关”取代了党本身。早在1904年托洛茨基就说过，“我们的党的体制不能是兵营体制”，无产阶级专政不能变成“对无产阶级的专政”[20]。托洛茨基在10月8日的信中写道：目前的制度“比军事共产主义最严酷的日子的制度离工人民主制还要远”；“在国内战争的严酷时刻，在党内，甚至在报刊上，曾就吸收专家、游击作风和正规军、纪律等等问题展开争论，而现在甚至根本不想就党所真正关心的问题公开交换意见”。《四十六人声明》也说，“党内建立的这种制度是完全无法忍受的，它破坏党的独立自主；用一种特选的官僚机构来代替党，这种机构平时还能运转自如，但是在危机时刻就不可避免 地失灵，而面临现在正迫近的严重事变时，就有根本失败的危险”，他们把这叫做“一派专政的制度”。
<br><br>
季诺维也夫承认，党内缺乏民主，重大问题未经广大党员讨论就事先决定。他要求发挥全体党员和基层支部的主动性和创造性，就政治、经济问题在党内展开自由讨论。斯大林在《关于党的任务》的报告中也指出党内存在“战争时期的残余和习惯”要求让党员讨论他们所关心的一切问题，对党的机关提出的一切建议进行自由批评，还谈到如果没有特殊情况，“一切党组织和负责人必须真正由选举产生”。
<br><br>
关于党的建设的决议在很大程度上只不过是重申俄共十大关于党内民主的决议。它重申“工人民主制就是全体党员都有公开讨论党的生活中重大问题的自由。对这些问题进行争论的自由，以及自下而上地选举领导人和委员会”。决议要求保持生气勃勃的思想生活，能经常以批评的态度研究自己的过去，纠正自己的错误和对重大问题进行集体讨论。在任何情况下都不容许把批准书记的权力变成对书记的实际上的任命。决议强调，“只有采取这种工作方法，才有切实保证防止把一时的意见分歧变成具有上述一切后果的派别集团。为防止这种情况，需要党的领导机构听取广大群众的呼声，不要把任何批评都看成是派别活动的表现，也不要因此把那些忠诚的和守纪律的党员推上搞小圈子和派别活动的道路。”可以看出，对党内生活的缺点，对实行工人民主制的必要性，对克服缺点的基本措施等问题，争论双方的分歧并不明显。他们的分歧与其说是在理论上，不如说是在具体执行的行动上。
<br><br>
同民主问题有密切关系的是反官僚主义的问题。当时官僚主义现象严重，对此双方并无分歧。分歧在于对官僚主义的进一步分析上。斯大林认为官僚主义是战时的残余，主要在地方。“我们党的无产阶级路线是正确的，但地方上在实践中用官僚主义的态度歪曲了这一路线。”党的工作中的缺点是官僚主义的国家机关对党和党的工作人员施加压力的结果。这就是说党本身是不会有官僚主义的。
<br><br>
托洛茨基作了另一种分析。他认为，官僚主义不是个别省组织的偶然特征，而是一种普遍的现象。他不是从县里经过省向中央发展的，恰恰相反，是从中央经过省向县里发展的。它决不是战争时期的“残余”，而正是最近几年积累起来的行政命令方法搬到党内来的结果。官僚主义不仅仅是一种工作方法或工作作风，而是一种社会现象，即一定的管理人和事的制度。党的书记把全部事务都集中在少数人手里，甚至集中到书记一人手里。而为了统管一切，书记就得为自己建立起官僚部门，并以这个同苏维埃机构相接近的附属机构，把自己同生气勃勃的党隔离开来，这就使党内的官僚主义越来越严重，使党的领导被他的执行机关(党委会、执行局、书记处等等)所取代，结果机关取代了党。所以托洛茨基认为，党内官僚主义不是过去的古董，而是一种实质上由党的新任务、新职能、新困难和新错误所产生的新现象。
<br><br>
在谈到官僚化的后果时，托洛茨基提出了引起争论的老一代人蜕化的问题。他写道：“官僚化的长期发展会造成这样一些危险：脱离群众，把全部注意力集中在管理、挑选和调动的问题上，缩小眼界，削弱革命嗅觉，也就是说，或多或少使老一代至少是其中相当一部分人向机会主义蜕化。”<br><br>

争论还涉及派别和小集团问题。斯大林指责托洛茨基同意禁止派别，但主张有组织小集团的自由。托洛茨基否认这种指责，声明他并不主张小集团的自由。但他认为，派别集团产生的重要原因是党的机关的官僚主义，它压制批评，使不满情绪越来越大。它总是喜欢给提出批评或警告的人或集体带上一顶派别活动的帽子。物极必反，机械的集中制必然由派别活动来补充，而后者是一种可怕的政治危险。他的说法是同12月5日的决议一致的：“需要党的领导机构听取广大党员群众的呼声，不要认为任何批评都是 派别活动的表现，也不要因此把那些诚诚恳恳和守纪律的党员推上搞小圈子和派别活动的道路。”正因为如此，托洛茨基认为，派别集团光靠禁止是不行的，关键是要消除产生派别集团的根源――官僚主义和不民主的制度，使广大党员能行使自己的民主权利，可以对党内的重大问题发表意见。
<br><br>
斯大林对派别集团产生的原因作了另一种解释，他否定集团产生的原因是由于中央官僚主义制度的说法，而把它归结为阶级的原因：一、苏联存在各种各样的经济形式；二、新经济政策下容许资本主义存在，资本主义思想渗入党内；三、党内有工人、农民 和知识分子三种成分。“这就是某些分子离开党而组织集团的原因”[21]。<br><br>

实际上党内的意见分歧和派别集团的存在，虽然可能同一定的阶级利益有联系，但更多的是对建设社会主义的方法、途径或具体政策上的认识和方案上的差异造成的，只有清醒地看到这一点才能比较正确地处理党内的意见分歧。在这一点上托洛茨基的说法比较符合实际，他说：“党对同一个任务往往可以通过不同的途径来解决。至于那一条途径更好、更短、更经济，是会发生意见分歧的。这类意见分歧可能由于问题的性质不同而涉及广大党员，但这并不一定意味着这里有两种阶级倾向在进行斗争。” 这时候，托洛茨基并没有组织派别集团。到1923年底，还没有直接指责托洛茨基组织反对派集团的说法，直到1924年初才逐渐给托洛茨基等人上纲上线。1924年1月全会把托洛茨基、拉狄克、皮达可夫等正式算作“反对派”，说是“以托洛茨基为首的反对派”。
<br><br>
“新方针”争论中的另一个大问题是经济政策问题。当时新经济政策刚刚开始不久，对于许多重大的经济问题，党的领导还不知道如何处理，一些涉及新经济政策的理论问题还刚刚开始研究和探讨，所以关于经济政策问题的争论最多只是提出问题罢了。可以看得出来的是，托洛茨基等把实行新经济政策后资本主义经济的发展估计得过于严重，认为出现了资本主义积累过程，严重威胁了社会主义国营经济。他们在经济问题上的观点和主张远比不上在党内民主和官僚主义问题上的观点和主张那么有说服力，那么切合苏联的实际。
<br><br>
关于“新方针”的争论在苏共党史的著作中都说是一场反“托洛茨基主义”的斗争，反对托洛茨基派别集团的斗争。就发展的结果而论，也确实如此。当时党内的多数派一开始就把党内一部分党员对党的方针政策所发表的批评意见说成是“派别活动的信号”，继而发展到组织各种声讨会，最后给反对派戴上“背离列宁主义”、“小资产阶级倾向”之类的帽子。俄共第十三次代表会议通过决议，指责托洛茨基反对派“不仅企图修正列宁主义，而且具有十分明显的小资产阶级倾向”，客观上反映了小资产阶级向无产阶级政党的立场和政策的进攻。
<br><br>
在列宁病倒不能视事的情况下，开展反对托洛茨基的斗争，显然是违背列宁的意愿的。列宁在《给代表大会的信》中所担心的正是斯大林和托洛茨基两人的冲突带来的党的分裂的危险。列宁不希望他们两人之间闹摩擦和冲突，而希望两人能合作共事，因此主张用撤消斯大林的总书记职务、用增加中央委员的人数来增加中央的稳定性，防止党的分裂。然而，列宁的这些嘱咐未能防止这类悲剧的出现，竟然在列宁的最后时日掀起了冲突的第一个高潮。<br><br>

争论是围绕民主问题展开的，为的是推进党内民主。大家都说需要民主，然而却以不民主的办法结束，这就是列宁以后的党内生活的可悲局面。正因为缺乏正常的民主制度，到1920年代末斯大林可以用先斩后奏的办法废除新经济政策，实行消灭富农的政策。而到了1930年代，斯大林一人竟可以决定中央委员和政治局委员的生死。<br><br>

列宁对这场争论持什么态度?那时列宁在哥尔克养病，已完全脱离政治生活，但从秋天起病情有所好转。1923年11月7日至12月，列宁不断浏览报纸，请克鲁普斯卡娅给他读托洛茨基及其拥护者关于党的建设的争论的文件。1924年1月中旬召开党的第十三次代表会议， 1月17―18日列宁浏览报纸，看《真理报》上的关于代表会议的报道，让克鲁普斯卡娅读给他听。19―20日，她给列宁读报纸上的代表会议决议。她后来写道：“星期六(1月19日)看来弗拉基米尔・伊里奇激动不安起来，我告诉他，决议是一致通过的。星期六和星期天我们是在读决议中度过的。弗拉基米尔・伊里奇听得非常仔细，有时还提问题。”[22]列宁对会议的关心，特别是它的“激动不安”，是值得注意的。可惜的是对这种敏感的问题，在当时的处境下克鲁普斯卡娅不可能明明白白写清楚。也许可以说，列宁病情的急剧恶化以及最后死亡，是同党内斗争的形势有直接关系的。<br><br>

列宁逝世之后，1924年1月29日，克鲁普斯卡娅写信给托洛茨基说：“弗・伊・(列宁)在您从西伯利亚到伦敦找我们时形成的对您的态度，直到他去世为止始终没有变。”[23]他们的第一次会见是在1902年的秋天，在伦敦的列宁热情地接待了第一次逃亡国外的托洛茨基，对这个年轻人寄予很大的希望。克鲁普斯卡娅当然清楚地知道这以后两人间的一致和分歧，她在列宁尸骨未寒之际，向托洛茨基转达这个信息，显然不是心血来潮的冲动，这是对列宁和托洛茨基关系的简短总结!
<br><br>
1924年9月，托洛茨基为他的《托洛茨基全集》第3卷《1917年》写了一篇序言，名为《十月的教训》。文章有强烈的针对性，其中指名道姓地指出“三驾马车”的成员――加米涅夫、季诺维也夫和斯大林在1917年犯有错误。这是直接向“三驾马车”发出的挑战。
<br><br>
从历史学的角度，从十月革命史的角度看，托洛茨基的这一著作在十月革命史的研究中具有重要位置。它第一次尖锐地提出十月革命中的许多关键问题，如对临时政府的态度问题，对待武装起义的态度问题。《十月的教训》提纲挈领地表述了托洛茨基对革 命过程中一系列重大问题的看法。他以一贯严谨的作风，有根有据地摆事实，谈理论。对他所作的评论可以提出不同的看法，但他所列举的事实并没有伪造歪曲。此文以及他后来写就的《俄国革命史》，迄今为止仍然是研究俄国和苏联历史的重要著作。
<br><br>
对三驾马车的直接攻击自然无法被容忍，《十月的教训》加上回忆列宁的《论列宁》引发了新一轮的争论，当时叫“书面争论”。表面上争论的是历史问题，实际上是现实问题，是权力问题。这一次季诺维也夫出手了，他要求把托洛茨基开除出党，斯大林扮演了温和的折衷角色，反对“割除”的流血政策。结果以解除托洛茨基的革命军事委员会主席和陆海军人民委员的职务了结。托洛茨基改任租让委员会主席、电器技术管理局局长等职务。<br><br>

在1925年这一年，出现了以季诺维也夫和加米涅夫为首的“新反对派”，参加这一派的甚至有列宁夫人克鲁普斯卡娅。这是一个内部观点并不完全一致的派别，只有两点把他们联结在一起：一个是反对斯大林的“一国社会主义”理论，另一个就是反对斯大林的领袖地位。托洛茨基暂时按兵不动，静观其变。直到1926年初托洛茨基才下决心同季诺维也夫建立联盟，这就是有名的“托季联盟”。这是一个相当勉强的联盟，他们从过去相互攻击，势不两立，到联合起来，主要的也还是两点――理论上季诺维也夫不同意斯大林的“一国社会主义”理论，他的《列宁主义》一书坚持了传统的社会主义观点；实践上季诺维也夫和加米涅夫经过同斯大林的合作，已经看清斯大林的面目，深知不能与此人共事。加米涅夫在联共第十四次代表大会上大声疾呼：斯大林不能成为团结全党的核心。这样，托洛茨基同他们就有了共同语言，结成了为时已晚的联盟――“托季联盟”。这时候斯大林已经羽翼丰满，在组织上严密地控制了党，形成一股强大的势力，而托洛茨基和季诺维也夫则由于长期互相攻击，互揭老底而两败俱伤。在这种情况下要打倒斯大林实际上已经不可能。
<br><br>
在这段时间里托洛茨基给后人留下的最大遗产是对斯大林“一国社会主义”理论的揭露和批判，还有就是他的战友普列奥布拉任斯基同布哈林就社会主义经济规律所展开的论战。就具体政策而言，“托季联盟”所提出的主张都显得过左和极端。他们要求高速度工业化，要求打击以至消灭农村的富农阶级和城市的耐普曼。他们把布哈林看作是“右派”，而把斯大林看作是“中派”，因而把批判的矛头对准了布哈林，把斯大林看作是可以争取的盟友。这样他们的批判方向就完全错了。从这里人们也可以看出，斯大林同托洛茨基在某种程度上的一致――争论归争论，实际上他们之间存在内在一致的东西。1929年在联共4月全会上布哈林曾列举了对他的六项指责： 1・对工业化估计不足；2・不懂得只有依靠我们强大的工业才能改造农民； 3・不懂得在农村的支柱、社会基础是贫农和雇农阶级，而指靠富农； 4・不懂得农民经济是小资产阶级经济，对富农估计不足； 5・富农和平长入社会主义理论； 6・把列宁的合作社计划同他的电气化计划对立起来。斯大林手下的卡冈诺维奇中计回答说，“对你来说这张清单是正确的”。布哈林当即指出，这几项指责逐字逐句摘自托洛茨基给联共(布)十五大的政纲。这就是说，斯大林和托洛茨基两人对布哈林的指责是相同的。从后来斯大林同布哈林的分歧以及斯大林对布哈林的批判可以看出，斯大林同托洛茨基尽管有不共戴天之仇，但从根本上说有许多相同或类似之处，以致后来有人说，斯大林比托洛茨基还托洛茨基。
<br><br>
同季诺维也夫的结盟从一开始就注定要失败。他们联合得太晚了。如果在列宁逝世后他们立即联合起来，执行列宁在给代表大会的信上提出的建议，撤消斯大林的总书记职务，那么苏联和苏共的命运也许会大大改观。而自从为纪念列宁而吸收了25万新党员以来，党的成分大大改变，各级机关已安插上大量斯大林的人，整个组织系统完全掌握在总书记手中。这个党已开始听命于斯大林一人。托洛茨基所说的“党的机关”取代党本身已经成为事实。
<br><br>
1926年10月托洛茨基被撤消政治局委员的职务， 1927年1月被撤消共产国际执行委员会委员的职务， 11月被开除出党， 1928年1月被流放到阿拉木图。那时候还没有对反对派开杀戒，在1920年代对孟什维克以及其他持不同政见者，大多采取驱逐出境的办法。这使托洛茨基得以保全性命，甚至随身携带大量文件档案出境。<br><br>

1929年1月托洛茨基被驱逐出国，开始了他最后一次长期流亡生活。他先后流亡土耳其(1929―1933年)，法国(1933―1935年)，挪威(1935―1936年)等地，最后定居墨西哥(1937―1940年)。流亡期间托洛茨基主要从事两项工作：一是从事著述。从1929年至1940年托洛茨基留给后世大量的著作，其中有批判共产国际策略方针的《列宁以后的共产国际》，系统阐述其不断革命理论，批驳斯大林“一国社会主义”理论的《不断革命》，记叙俄国1917年二月革命和十月革命历史的《俄国革命史》，解剖苏联社会和联共党的《被背叛的革命》，揭露斯大林伪造历史的《斯大林伪造学派》，制定 第四国际策略方针的《资本主义的垂死呻吟和第四国际的任务》宣言以及因遇害而未完成的《斯大林。对其人及其影响的评价》等等，此外，还编辑出版了《反对派通报》。二是进行组织工作，刚开始的时候是组织留在苏联国内的反对派，然后逐渐扩大到国外的托派，最后成立第四国际。<br><br>

在这两项工作中比较有价值的是他的著作，包括他的历史著作和现实问题的著作。托洛茨基本人是俄国许多历史事件的参加者和目击者，又拥有大量在苏联严格保密的档案资料，这就使他的历史著作具有独特的重要意义。而他关于苏联现实问题的著作，由于他是过来人，熟悉马克思主义和列宁的思想，对苏联的现实有亲身感受，因此他的分 析苏联问题的著作具有西方学者所无法比拟的深度。他在1936年写就的《被背叛的革命》一书，对苏联社会及其存在的问题的分析至今对研究苏联解体问题仍然有参考价值。他的未完成的《斯大林》一书尽管笔下有明显的个人感情色彩，但仍然不失为一本材料相当丰富，内容基本可信的斯大林传记。托洛茨基的这些著作加上在他在《反对派通报》上发表的大量文章，是研究托洛茨基思想和苏联问题的重要资料，不能简单地以“反苏”、“反共”来概括，并且应当说，托洛茨基从来不反共，他的共产主义信念至死 也没有放弃，当然对什么是共产主义，什么是社会主义，他有自己的理解。
<br><br>
他对共产国际的否定有他的道理。列宁逝世之后共产国际推行错误的理论和政策，把共产国际变成联共(布)的一个支部，变成单纯的保卫苏联的工具，在国际共产主义运动中瞎指挥，干预其他国家共产党的内部事务，凡此等等，越演越烈。托洛茨基对共产国际的某些批评是对的，符合实际的。但是他本人所坚持的共产国际早期的“世界革命”方针，却是一种不切实际的空想。这一方针还在列宁生前已经证明是失败的。第四国际把各国的极左分子组织在一起，脱离时代，脱离群众，脱离各国的具体实际，鼓吹 世界革命，他们的主张得不到实施，他们的组织得不到群众的拥护，始终是一个人数不多的小组织。可以说，托洛茨基在这方面的工作是极不成功的。
<br><br>
托洛茨基是被斯大林驱逐出国的。显然斯大林不久就后悔了，把这样一个死对头放到国外去自由行动，是对斯大林的极大威胁。所以托洛茨基在国外多次遇刺，他所携带的档案遇盗，就不足为怪了。托洛茨基一家的命运是悲惨的。儿子列夫・谢多夫是他流亡国外的主要助手， 1938年在巴黎的一家医院可疑地死去。女儿齐娜在柏林自杀身亡，而留在苏联从事科技工作的儿子谢尔盖则被斯大林逮捕，最后死在集中营。<br><br>

托洛茨基本人最终也没有能摆脱斯大林的魔掌。1940年5月23日托洛茨基在墨西哥的寓所遭到不明身份的武装分子的袭击，托洛茨基一家幸免于难。但是没过多久，克格勃的特工，一个名叫拉蒙・梅尔卡德的西班牙人混进托洛茨基的宅院，用冰斧击中托洛茨基的头部，托受致命伤，抢救无效，于8月21日去世。他虽然逃过了斯大林30年代大审判的子弹，但最后仍不免丧生在斯大林杀手的冰斧之下。他多活了几年，但其最终结局同留在国内的他的战友是一样的。唯一的不同是他没有在“无产阶级法庭”上遭受那种屈辱，用不着“悔过”，用不着把自己鬼化，至死保持了人的尊严，保持了一个革命者的尊严。<br><br>

## 我们也<a href= "link08.html">中国应该有中国梦</a><br><br>

托洛茨基的著名研究者伊萨克・多伊彻对托洛茨基的一生有如下一段评述：<br><br>

托洛茨基的生涯是如此丰富与辉煌，以至随便拿出它的片断都足以构成一个杰出历史人物的故事。如果他在1917年前的某个时候死去，他就会跻身于别林斯基、赫尔岑及巴枯宁这样一些俄国思想家与革命家之列，成为堪与他们匹敌的马克思主义者晚辈。如果他的生命在1921年左右结束，大约与列宁同时，那么留在人们记忆里的就是十月革命的领导人，红军的缔造者和国内战争中的总司令，并且作为共产国际的导师，他以马克思才有的力量与才华，以《共产党宣言》以后人们再也未曾听到过的语调向全世界的工人说话。他所主张的思想以及他作为1923―1929年反对派领导人所完成的工作，形成了布尔什维主义与共产主义编年史中最重要、最悲壮一章的总结和实质。他是本世纪最大一场意识形态论战中的主角，是工业化与计划经济思想的倡导者。最后，他是布尔什维克党内抵制斯大林主义抬头的那些人的喉舌。哪怕他未能活过1927年，他也在身后留下了一份思想遗产。这份遗产，时间将赋予它越来越重要的意义，而新一代苏联人将根据它去摸索自己的道路。<br><br>

他这段话有一些判断是对的，但不尽然。托洛茨基之所以出名，主要是他的两段经历，一是参加并领导了俄国的十月武装起义，创建了红军并取得了国内战争的胜利。这是托洛茨基一生中最辉煌的时期，他的功绩使他赢得了同列宁齐名的崇高地位。如果没有这一段历史，即在1917年死去，那么人们在历史上知道的恐怕只是一个战地记者或者写过一些文学评论的马克思主义评论家，还有就是在1905年曾担任了几天彼得堡苏维埃主席。那时作为党派人物，他是不足道的，他游离于布尔什维克、孟什维克之间，始终没有能够组成一个多少有影响的党派――从上世纪初到1917年，围绕在他身边的一直是一个人数不多的小团体。在马克思主义理论上，不少人显然在他之上。普列汉诺夫、列宁自不用说，像孟什维克阵营中的马尔托夫，在理论修养方面也不在他之下。他的名声甚至未必能超过在1905年革命期间和他一起创造“不断革命论”的帕尔乌斯。<br><br>

可以说，如果没有1917年的十月革命，也就不会有后人所知道的托洛茨基。<br><br>

使托洛茨基出名的第二段历史是他同斯大林的斗争。在列宁逝世前后，是他第一个举起反斯大林的旗子，自此以后，他同斯大林就成为不共戴天的死对头。斯大林把他的主张概括成“托洛茨基主义”，还加上一个“反列宁主义”的定语。这就使托洛茨基从此在国际共产主义运动中无立足之地，把他永远革出了教门。多伊彻说得对，如果托洛茨基像列宁那样，在20年代初去世，那么他在苏联历史上，在国际共产主义运动史上，无疑是一个革命的领袖，赢得国内战争的英雄，使世界资产阶级胆战心惊的红军统帅。但是他那时没有战死，没有病逝，这就注定了他要扮演一个重要的悲剧角色――以少数人去反对羽翼丰满的斯大林以及他的党机关，最后被他自己为之奋斗的政权流放到当时的不毛之地阿拉木图，尔后又被驱逐出国，成为有国难回，有家难归的流亡者。他的一 系列揭露和批判斯大林及其体制的著作，是最早出现的分析和剖析苏联当时的政治、经济、文化等等方面的著作，其达到的深度是同时代作家所难以企及的。<br><br>

使托洛茨基在理论思想领域出名的则是他的“不断革命”论。“不断革命”论是托洛茨基在1905年革命中同帕尔乌斯一起提出来的。后来他在《1905年》一书中总结他的“不断革命”论时写道：<br><br>

直接摆在俄国革命面前的虽然是资产阶级的目的，可是它不能停留在这些目的上面。除非使无产阶级执掌政权，革命就不能解决它当前的资产阶级任务。而无产阶级掌握政权后，又不能以革命的资产阶级范围来限制自己。恰恰相反，无产阶级先锋队正是 为了保证自己的胜利，还在他统治的初期，就不仅要最深刻地侵犯封建所有制，而且要最深刻地侵犯资产阶级所有制。在这种情形下，它不仅会和那些在无产阶级革命斗争初期支持过它的一切资产阶级集团发生敌对的冲突，而且会和那些协助过它取得政权的广大农民群众发生敌对的冲突。在农民占人口绝大多数的落后国家内，工人政府所处地位的矛盾，只有在国际范围内即在无产阶级世界革命舞台上，才能求得解决。在由于历史的必然性而突破了俄国革命狭隘的资产阶级民主主义的范围之后，胜利的无产阶级将不 得不突破其民族国家的范围，也就是应当自觉地力求使俄国革命成为世界革命的序幕。<br><br>

简而言之，俄国革命是民主革命，但必须由无产阶级来领导，无产阶级一旦取得政权，就不能把革命限制在民主革命的范围之内，必须立即向社会主义革命转变，这就必然要侵犯资产阶级所有制，从而同广大农民发生敌对冲突，孤立无援的俄国无产阶级只有在国外，得到西方先进国家胜利的无产阶级的支援，才能保持政权，坚持下去。<br><br>

1917年的俄国革命基本上是按这一思路发展的。二月革命后列宁立即提出了实行社会主义革命的方针，并在八个月之后领导无产阶级取得了政权，以无产阶级革命去顺 便解决民主革命的任务。在十月革命后的相当一段时间里，包括列宁在内的布尔什维克党的领导人也确实把拯救俄国革命的希望寄托在西方革命上。至于对农民作用的估计，托洛茨基得出的结论同列宁基本上是一致的。列宁认为，民主革命中无产阶级的同盟军是广大农民群众，而在社会主义革命中则是农村的无产者和半无产者――贫雇农阶级。他在《两种策略》中写道：无产阶级应当把民主革命进行到底，这就要把农民群众联合到自己方面来，以便用强力粉碎专制制度的反抗，并麻痹资产阶级的不稳定性。无产阶级应当实现社会主义革 命，这就要把居民中的半无产者联合到自己方面来，以便用强力摧毁资产阶级的反抗，并麻痹农民和小资产阶级的不稳定性[24]。
<br><br>
不久列宁又说：<br><br>

如果没有欧洲的社会主义无产阶级对俄国无产阶级的支援，那么，这个斗争对于孤军作战的俄国无产阶级，几乎是毫无希望的，而且必然要遭到失败[25]。<br><br>

在列宁生前，托洛茨基的著作是被当作正统的马克思主义著作看待的，并没有被看作异端邪说。
<br><br>
1924年以后，苏联出现了“一国社会主义”问题的争论。关于这一争论，需要指出的是，第一，在1924年以前布尔什维克党内并不存在分歧，分歧是从斯大林修改自 己先前的观点引起的。在此之前，斯大林本人也是认为苏联单独一国，凭自己的力量是不可能建成社会主义的。其次，斯大林对马克思恩格斯著作的引用和解释并不符合历史实际。恩格斯的谈到“共同胜利说”的《共产主义原理》一文的手稿直到1913年才公开发表，因此不可能像斯大林所说的，在《共产主义原理》的影响下，在第二国际存在一个共同胜利论占统治地位的时期。斯大林对列宁《论欧洲联邦口号》中的论断的引证也是牵强附会的。列宁那里所说的仅仅是一国可以首先开始革命，夺取政权，而没有涉及“建成”社会主义问题。为论证自己的新说法，斯大林甚至不惜篡改和删除列宁著作 中的有关语句[26]。
<br><br>
1929年托洛茨基在《不断革命》一书中把“不断革命”论发挥成三点： 1・从民主革命转变为社会主义革命是不断的。2・社会主义革命本身是不间断的。国内战争和对外战争同和平改革相互交替，经济、技术、科学、家庭和日常生活等方面的不断革命。3・社会主义革命的国际性――社会主义革命在民族的基础上开始，但不能在这个基础上结束。民族革命是国际链条中的一个环节，国际革命是一个不断的过程。
<br><br>
不过这三条中只有第一条是已有的观点，其余两条已不是原先提出的不断革命论的内涵了，它们并没有得到实践的证实。社会主义的发展与其说是“不断革命”的过程，倒不如像布哈林所说的，是一个“有机发展”的过程，“长入”的过程。
<br><br>
十月革命后，托洛茨基一直把希望寄托在西方的革命上。他的不断革命论就是立足于世界革命，首先是西方革命上的。他用“世界革命”来对抗斯大林的“一国社会主义”理论。然而十月革命后不久，客观形势就显示出，世界革命的期望是不现实的。对于社会主义革命来说，整个世界还缺乏必要的前提，作为社会经济形态的革命，需要旧的社会经济形态不但不能促进生产力的发展，而且真正成为生产力发展的桎梏，而只要这种社会经济形态还有生命力，还能通过自我调节继续发展，它就不会灭亡。在20世纪，资本主义就是处于这种状态。这就不能不使托洛茨基的希望和一切有关预言落空。在这方面列宁要比托洛茨基现实一点。列宁也是世界革命论者，但当他发现西方革命无望的时候，立即把目光转向东方，把国内工作的重心转移到经济文化建设上去。东方最后以另一种形式出现了列宁所期望的革命。事情很清楚，如果抽去了世界革命这根台柱，托洛茨基的不断革命论就无法立起来。
<br><br>
不过，托洛茨基对斯大林“一国社会主义”理论的批判仍有可取之处。他看到了 时代的发展，各国和各地域经济的发展逐渐形成世界性的经济，世界各国的经济形成了分工合作的关系，向国际分工发展的各国之间存在有机的相互依赖关系，在这种情况下，单独一国是不可能建成社会主义的。托洛茨基得出结论，为了取得社会主义的彻底胜利不仅需要欧洲几个最先进国家无产阶级革命的胜利，而且在此之前还必须同先进资本主义国家发展经济关系，利用它们的先进科学技术。他在《〈不断革命〉美国版序言》中写道：
<br><br>
马克思主义认为世界经济并不是各民族部分的总和，而是一种由国际分工和在我们这个时代中专横地统治着民族市场的世界市场所形成的强有力而独立的现实。资本主义 社会的生产力早已发展得超过了民族界限。(1914―1918年的)帝国主义战争就是这种事实的表现之一。在生产技术方面，社会主义社会必须代表比资本主义更高的阶段。如果要在民族范围内孤立地建设社会主义社会，那么，不管暂时取得多少成就，都意味着把生产力拉回到甚至比资本主义还落后的境地。不顾构成世界统一体的一部分的国家发展在地理、文化和历史方面的条件，而试图在一个民族范围内实行一种与外界隔绝的经济各部门的均衡，那就意味着追求一种反动的乌托邦[27]。
<br><br>
他指出苏联经济存在着一个巨大矛盾，即苏联工业的集中性质和苏联经济孤立处境 之间的矛盾；苏联工业的集中性为空前的发展提供了可能性，苏联经济的孤立处境则排除了正常利用世界经济潜力的可能性。托洛茨基得出的结论是正确的，他说：
<br><br>
世界范围的分工超出于单独一国的无产阶级专政之上，而且用命令的方式指出它前进的道路。十月革命没有把俄国排除于人类其他部分之外，反而使俄国同他们更密切地联系起来了[28]。
<br><br>
计划经济是马克思主义经典作家确定用以取代处于无政府状态的资本主义经济的。这个设想从理论上讲是合理的，然而实际操作起来却迄今没有一个成功的范例。在20年代的争论中，托洛茨基是计划经济的倡导者、鼓吹者，经常把经济上的问题归结为缺乏计划所致。他的主张有一定的合理性，也符合马克思主义的传统观点，然而他没有看到，在苏俄那种小农经济的汪洋大海之中，是根本不可能有什么绝对的计划经济可言的。而从30年代开始的苏联的计划经济，又充满了领导人的唯意志论，一切计划服从于政治的需要，制定的计划往往朝令夕改，数字指标任意规定和随意改变。人们在计划经济后面看到的不是严密科学的计划，而是领袖的个人意志。正因为如此，这种经济不可能调动广大工人和农民的劳动积极性，不可能有合理的资源配置，造成了经济中的极大浪费，建设事业的严重混乱。事实证明，计划并不是万能的，它不能解决小生产占多数的国家里在经济上所遇到的种种难题，即使经济发展了，也难以制定出一个无所不包的万能的经济计划。把计划当作社会主义经济的标志，是一个理论和认识的误区。在过渡时期或者在社会主义初级阶段，甚至在社会主义的发达阶段都需要充分发挥价值规律的作用，借助价值规律来调节生产，实现资源的最佳配置，调动广大劳动者的生产积极性。当然，在宏观调节上一定程度上的计划和国家干预是必要的，但像托洛茨基那样把整个希望都寄托在计划经济上，显然是不现实的。
<br><br>
工业化本来不是社会主义的任务。按照马克思的设想，当一个国家发展到必须进行社会主义革命的时候，就物质条件来说，工业化应该是已经完成了，旧的生产关系已经容纳不下工业化以后飞速发展的生产力。工业化的任务是在东方落后国家提前实行社会主义革命的情况下的补课任务。在革命之前未能实现国家的工业化，社会主义缺乏必要的物质基础，因此必须补课，努力实现国家的工业化。托洛茨基是苏联工业化的提出者，主张高速度发展工业，用剥夺农民的办法取得工业化所需要的资金。但是，苏联国家工业化的历史给我们提供的教训是欲速则不达。苏联30年代在斯大林领导下进行的工业化采取了不顾苏联的国情，盲目的高速度的工业化，用剥夺农民的办法取得工业化所必须的资金，在某种程度上是实现了国家的工业化，但付出的代价太大，并且其成果仅仅是国家的重工业化、军事工业化，而不是全面工业化，农业仍然停留在落后的水平上，与人民生活息息相关的轻工业受到严重的抑制，整个国民经济出现严重的失衡。斯大林的实践是托洛茨基所鼓吹的工业化的一面镜子，尽管托洛茨基可以说，这是一面变形的镜子，也许由他来实施情况会好一些，但整体上未必会有大的改观。
<br><br>
至于农业集体化，这同列宁当年所说的合作社是全然不同的东西。斯大林以消灭富农为起点在农村实行集体化。这实际上也是大体符合托洛茨基的主张的。看看斯大林集体化的后果就可以大致估计出托洛茨基的集体化是怎么回事了。问题在于，在落后的苏联，在20年代几乎不存在富农阶级，因为通过国内战争时期贫苦农民委员会所实施的剥夺，革命前的富农已经不再存在。新经济政策时期存在的所谓富农，多半是些善于经营的基本上通过劳动发家致富的中农，甚至贫农。在他们的经营活动中也存在程度不等的剥削，但在量上远远没有达到革命前的富农程度。这些人的生产经营对当时城乡经济的发展起了积极的作用，在20年代末，没有任何理由去消灭他们。列宁提倡的合作社同斯大林推行的集体农庄的区别是非常明显的。合作社是农民自愿的组织形式，是本来意义上的集体经济，在这里农民是合作社的主人。而从苏联的实践看，集体农庄仅仅是一种为保证政府得到它所需要的农产品的连环保组织，农民在这里除了双手以外基本上一无所有。农民，现在叫农庄庄员，不再拥有生产资料和土地，没有耕种土地的自主权，甚至失去了人身的自由――他们没有身份证，没有自由流动的权利，不能随意到城市去打工。政府也不保障他们的温饱，对许多集体农庄，政府只管收粮，庄员只能靠一小块宅旁园地养活一家。至于集体化过程中大批反对集体化的农民被当作富农流放，农民们大量杀猪宰羊，造成农村牲口的大量减少，那就不必说了。其直接结果是连续两年的饥荒，其远期后果是苏联的农业长期落后，直至50年代初期还没有达到沙俄1913年的水平!可以说，集体化消灭的不是“富农”，而是全体农民。如果由托洛茨基来实行集体化，过程也许会有所不同，例如少一些强制和暴力，但总的情况或者方向，不会有什么区别。因为集体农庄这个形式本身就存在问题，不是一种能够解决农业问题的组 织。
<br><br>
斯大林的工业化和集体化是托洛茨基予以肯定的为数不多的几个措施。可以说，托洛茨基所坚持的东西，大体上没有违背传统的社会主义学说。可惜的是托洛茨基这种教条式的坚持，脱离了俄国的现实。他对布哈林的批判是一种倒退。因为到20年代，布哈林已经摆脱了左的极端主义，开始正视俄国的落后的现实。他坚持列宁的合作社思想，反对集体化方针，反对对农民使用强制和暴力，反对对农民实行剥夺政策，主张让农民发展自己的经济，甚至号召他们“发财”。他主张国民经济的平衡发展，保持农轻重的一定比例，反对不顾国情的高速度的片面发展重工业。托洛茨基完全看错了人，把 打击的矛头对准了布哈林。斯大林后来开展的“反右倾”斗争，其始作俑者乃托洛茨基!布哈林帮助斯大林打倒了托洛茨基，托洛茨基则给斯大林提供了反对布哈林的现成思想武器!
<br><br>
30年代托洛茨基在国外所写的论文和专著，对苏联现实的剖析。对斯大林的批判和揭露，是对“苏联学”的重大贡献，也许可以说他是西方后来盛行的“苏联学”的开创者。他毕竟是从这个国家出去的，他对这个国家有深入的了解，他懂得马克思主义，知道列宁的想法，清楚这个政权的长处和缺点，因此，从他的笔头出来的东西，不像西 方作家所写的那样往往给人隔靴挠痒的感觉。
<br><br>
1936年托洛茨基写了《被背叛的革命(苏联的现状及其前途)》，对当时的苏维埃政权进行了剖析，他对马克思主义的某些理论的理解和阐述，他对苏联社会所作的分析，仍能给人以某种启迪。这是托洛茨基留给我们的值得批判地吸收的遗产。
<br><br>
托洛茨基对苏联的前途提出两种可能性，一种是工人推翻官僚的统治。这种结局后来并没有出现(只有波兰出现了这种结局，但推翻以后并没有继续社会主义道路!)，且按下不表。第二种结局是资本主义在苏联的复辟。托洛茨基对第二种进程有这样一段描述：
<br><br>
如果资产阶级政党推翻了苏维埃统治阶层，它就会在目前的官僚、行政人员、技术人员、经理、党的书记以及整个享受特权的上层中找到不少现成的奴仆。当然，在这种情况下也需要对国家机关进行清洗，不过资产阶级复辟所需要清除的人，要比革命政党清除的人少。不过，新政权的主要任务将会是恢复生产资料的私有制。首先要创造条件从力量单薄的集体农庄分出殷实的农场，把富裕的集体农庄变成资产阶级类型的生产合作社，变成农业股份公司。在工业部门，非国有化将从轻工业和食品工业开始。计划原则在过渡时期会改变为在国家政权和各‘公司’之间采取的妥协措施，这些公司即是从工业部门的苏联官员、其流亡国外的原业主和外国资本家中产生的潜在的所有主。尽管苏维埃官僚为资产阶级复辟作了大量的准备，但在所有制形式和经营方法上，新制度还必须进行社会变革(переворот)，而不是改良(реформа)。
<br><br>
这段话无须解释，人们在苏联解体时所看到的基本上就是这样一幅图景。这里仅举一个数字。现今的俄国流行一个名词“在册权贵”(номенкратура)，指的是苏联时期列入上级任命的各级(尤其是高级)干部名册的党政官员，是一般名词“官僚”的具体化。有一项资料表明，在上世纪90年代有75%以上的政治精英和61%的商业精英来自“在册权贵”。来自这个群体的人，在总统周围占75%，政府中占74・3%[29]。这些数字说明了苏联的某些党政干部在剧变中以及剧变后的作用。看看这些数字，看看剧变的过程和剧变后的变化过程，不能不佩服托洛茨基的预见，或者用多伊彻的话说“先知”。

托洛茨基的一生是一个革命家的一生。到现在为止，几乎所有斯大林刀下之鬼，都由官方正式恢复了名誉(只有像叶若夫那样的刽子手除外)，但托洛茨基并没有获得苏联当局的正式平反，理由是他没有被正式判刑。即使如此，斯大林当年给托洛茨基加上的几个最大的罪名，如“托洛茨基主义”、“社会民主主义”、“德国法西斯的间谍”、“帝国主义的走狗”，也没有一个是能够成立的。如果有“托洛茨基主义”的话，那么，这个“托洛茨基主义”同“社会民主主义”相去何止十万八千里。而自从法西斯德国失败以来，德国的档案已被公开，历史学家并没有从这成堆的档案中找到任何可以证明托洛茨基投靠德国的文件。<br><br>

托洛茨基是悲剧人物。他参加无产阶级打天下的斗争，舍生忘死，起了远不是无足轻重的作用，但胜利后不久就有家归不得，继续他在革命前的流亡生活。先前他是被沙皇反动政府赶出去的，后来又被无产阶级政府驱逐出境。他在国外尽管进行了大量的反对和揭露斯大林的工作，但他还是承认，苏维埃政权是工人政权，社会主义革命的果实尚未完全丧失。当苏联面临法西斯德国进攻的危险时，他号召保卫这个工人国家。他坚持工业化和计划经济，主张在农村实行集体化。他的这些主张，在提出之初曾受到斯大林的猛烈批判，被冠之以“超工业化”、“剥夺农民”的罪名。然而，在他被驱逐出国之后，斯大林马上放手搞起全盘集体化，彻底剥夺农民，实行高速工业化，其所采取的措施，所定的速度，是托洛茨基本人当年也不敢设想的。<br><br>

纵观托洛茨基的社会主义观点，有几条是他始终坚持的，这就是世界革命、阶级斗争、无产阶级专政、公有制、计划经济、工业化和农业集体化。因此，尽管他对斯大林的批判指责甚多，但除了世界革命，斯大林的许多主张同托洛茨基的差别并不大，有的也就是五十步与一百步之差。列宁的新经济政策提出了另一种思路，另一种发展的选择，但托洛茨基所坚持的只是上述几点，至于利用市场商品货币关系来建设社会主义的主张，并没有得到他的支持。在这一点上，托洛茨基显然落后于同时代的布哈林，在理论方面他把布哈林作为主要的攻击对象，显然不是偶然的。他同布哈林的争论才真正是两种社会主义建设方法的争论。
<br><br>
恩格斯在谈到空想社会主义时曾经指出，“不成熟的理论，是同不成熟的资本主义生产状况、不成熟的阶级状况相适应的。解决社会问题的办法还隐藏在不发达的社会经济关系中，所以只有从头脑中产生出来”[30]。恩格斯的这一重要论点既适用于十月革命后的苏联，也适用于托洛茨基的理论观点。我们完全有理由说，不成熟的社会主义理论是同不成熟的社会主义状况相适应的，解决社会主义问题的办法还隐藏在不发达的社会经济关系中。1920―1930年代苏联的社会现实还没有从理论上和实践上为我们今天所看到的社会主义市场经济的实施提供充分的根据。问题还仅仅在暴露之中，要从某些迹象中得出人们在半个多世纪后才得出的结论，托洛茨基显然还缺乏这种“先知”的本领。不能苛求于古人，托洛茨基毕竟是历史的人，而不是先知。<br><br>

<b><a name="T14">我党对托洛茨基评价的转变</a> </b><br>
<hr><br>

2006年11月13日 北京日报<br><br>


每当提到托洛茨基或以他为首的“托派”，人们往往是谈虎色变。盖因自上世纪20年代末以来，在整整几代人心目中，托洛茨基或“托派”都是反动或反革命的代名词。<br><br> 

随着国内外形势的变化和党史、共运史研究的深入，我党对托洛茨基的评价，有了一个巨大的转变过程。 <br><br>

人民出版社1952年版《毛泽东选集》第一卷《论反对日本帝国主义的策略》一文中，针对托洛茨基的注释是这样写的:“托洛茨基集团，原是俄国工人运动中的一个反对列宁主义的派别，后来堕落成为完全反革命的匪帮。关于这个叛徒集团的演变，斯大林同志于一九三七年在联共中央全会上的报告里，作过如下的说明:‘过去，在七八年前，托洛茨基主义是工人阶级中这样的政治派别之一，诚然，是一个反列宁主义的、因而也就是极端错误的政治派别，可是它当时总算是一个政治派别……现时的托洛茨基主义，并不是工人阶级中的政治派别，而是一伙无原则的和无思想的暗害者、破坏者、侦探间谍、杀人凶手的匪帮，是受外国侦探机关雇用而活动的工人阶级死敌的匪帮。’”从这条注释可以看出，当时我党对托洛茨基的评价是引用了斯大林报告中的原话，对托洛茨基极尽丑化诋毁之能事。 <br><br>

随着国内国际形势发生巨大变化，我党对托洛茨基的评价也逐步地发生了微妙的较客观的转变。人民出版社1991年版《毛泽东选集》第一卷《论反对日本帝国主义的策略》文中，关于托洛茨基的注释修改为如下内容:“托洛茨基(一八七九――一九四○)，俄国十月革命胜利后曾任革命军事委员会主席等职。列宁逝世后，反对列宁关于在苏联建设社会主义的理论和路线，一九二七年十一月被清除出党。在国际共产主义运动中，托洛茨基进行了许多分裂和破坏活动。”从注释内容的整体来看，对托洛茨基的评价依然是负面的。但是，这里有两个改变:一、注释中加入了一句很重要的话，“俄国十月革命胜利后曾任革命军事委员会主席等职”。肯定了托洛茨基在十月革命胜利后军事领域的工作。二、删去了原注释中大量丑化和诬蔑性的词汇。 <br><br>

<a href= "link11.html">邓小平承诺"永不称霸"</a><br><br>
<a href= "link10.html">2014：奥巴马西点演讲</a><br><br>


更大的改变接踵而至。人民出版社1993年版《毛泽东文集》第一卷《中国共产党红军第四军第九次代表大会决议案》一文中，对托洛茨基的注释又有所不同:“托洛茨基(一八七九――一九四○)，曾任俄国社会民主工党(布尔什维克)中央政治局委员、革命军事委员会主席等职。列宁逝世后，他反对列宁关于在苏联建设社会主义的理论和路线，在联共(布)党内组织反对派，进行派别活动，一九二七年十一月被开除出党。”注释中又有了三个可喜的变化:一、肯定了托洛茨基在布尔什维克党内的领导工作；二、颇带蔑视色彩的“清除”出党，改为了较中性的“开除”出党，体现了我党对托洛茨基态度的温和倾向；三、肯定了托洛茨基在国际共产主义运动中的历史功绩。仅就托洛茨基对中国革命的观点而言，中共党史出版社2002年新版《中国共产党历史》第一卷中，就有这样的表述:“托洛茨基对大革命后期蒋介石、汪精卫两个集团的阶级实质的认识，对他们将要叛变革命的判断，对斯大林在指导中国革命中的错误的批评，有些是正确的或基本正确的”，“托洛茨基认为斯大林应对中国大革命的失败负责。” <br><br>

就在20世纪即将结束的时候，人民出版社1999年版《毛泽东文集》第六卷《在中国共产党全国代表会议上的讲话》一文中，第七卷《在莫斯科共产党和工人党代表会议上的讲话》一文中，均有对托洛茨基的注释，对其评价发生了根本性的变化:“托洛茨基(一八七九――一九四○)，十月革命时，任俄国社会民主工党(布尔什维克)中央政治局委员、彼得格勒苏维埃主席。十月革命后，曾任外交人民委员、陆海军人民委员、革命军事委员会主席、共产国际执行委员会委员等职。一九二六年十月联共(布)中央全会决定，撤销他的中央政治局委员职务。一九二七年一月共产国际执行委员会决定，撤销他的执行委员职务，同年十一月被开除出党。一九二九年一月被驱逐出苏联。一九四○年八月在墨西哥遭暗杀。”首先，也是最重要的，这里删去了旧注释中“反对列宁关于在苏联建设社会主义的理论和路线”的评价，这等于说“反对列宁”是非真，所以应删去。其次，删去了原注中“在联共(布)党内组织反对派，进行派别活动”的评价，肯定了托洛茨基一直顾全党的团结的大局，致力于党内民主建设的功绩。第三，新注释中对托洛茨基在十月革命之前及之后各个领域中的工作给予了充分肯定，逐一点出了他所担任的重要职务。第四，使用了“遭暗杀”字样，体现了我党对托洛茨基之死的同情。 
<br><br>
至此，我党终于对托洛茨基有了一个较为客观公正的评价。(黎笳摘自《炎黄春秋》2006年第7期 作者马长虹 )

<b><a name="T15">苏联的东正教</a> </b><br>
<hr><br>



苏联的东正教（Eastern Orthodox Church），<br><br>

 东正教（Eastern Orthodox Church），又称正教会或正统教会，是基督教的主要宗派之一，是指依循由东罗马帝国所流传下来的基督教传统的教会。它是与天主教、新教并立的基督教三大派别之一，目前也是第二大教派，信徒主要分布在希腊、哈萨克斯坦、俄罗斯、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、塞尔维亚等东欧国家。“正教”的希腊语（Orthodxia）意思是正统。与天主教不同，正教由一些被称为“自主教会”或“自治教会”的地方教会组成，这些教会彼此独立，但却有着共同的信仰。<br><br>

罗斯受洗<br><br>

公元980年，留利克王朝第六代继承人弗拉基米尔登上基辅罗斯(古俄罗斯)大公宝
座。他发现他的国家虽已建立一百多年，却还极不统一。他还认识到，他的先辈主要靠武力
来统治国家，这个办法并不高明，不但疲于奔命，而且顾此失彼。于是他不再像他们那样亲
自率兵四处征伐，而是常住基辅统观全局，运筹帷幄。他感到国家统一须先有信仰统一。当
时的信仰主要是宗教信仰。东斯拉夫人绝大多数信多神教，每个部落有自己的主神，这严重
地阻碍着全国统一。弗拉基米尔本人也信多神教。他为了增进全国统一，曾下令在基辅王宫
附近一座小山上建筑一座多神庙，供奉主要部落的六尊主神木像(雷神佩伦，太阳神霍尔
斯、风神斯特里波格，女神莫科什，鸟神)，企图以此显示基辅团结统一着各部落。但这个
做法并未取得增进全国统一的效果，反而被理解为尊重各部落的自主和平等。弗拉基米尔痛
感需要一种全国都信奉的新宗教。他聆听了几个大教――犹太教、伊斯兰教、基督教中的天主
教和东正教两派――的代表宣讲教义，派人到国外了解，同时与臣属商议选择何种宗教。东
方的可萨人劝他皈依犹太教，大公问他们为什么犹太人会被从耶路撒冷赶出来，可萨人说是
因为犹太人犯罪受到上帝惩罚。大公拒绝了犹太教。东方另一民族保加尔人劝他信奉伊斯兰
教，但说入教后不许喝酒。弗拉基米尔笑道，  “喝酒是罗斯人的享受，我们不喝酒就活不下
去。”他没有接受伊斯兰教。罗马天主教没有赢得他的使节的好感，拜占廷东正教的隆重仪
式和金壁辉煌的索菲亚大教堂却使他们五体投地，使他们感到宛如置身天国。更主要的
是，以君士坦丁堡为首都的拜占廷帝国离罗斯近，经济远比罗斯发达，两国有着长期密切的
政治经济关系，东正教早已传入罗斯，已拥有一批信徒，包括弗拉基米尔大公的祖国奥丽加女
大公在内。弗拉基米尔决定选择东正教。公元986年，拜占廷皇帝瓦西里二世平叛未成，向罗
斯求援，弗拉基米尔提出援助先决条件：拜占廷把皇妹安娜嫁给他(他当时按多神教习俗已
有众多后妃)，罗斯定基督教为国教由拜占廷教士施洗时一切安排由罗斯决定。拜占廷同意
了这两个条件。但在弗拉基米尔出兵平定叛乱后，拜占廷迟迟不把安娜公主送来。弗拉基米
尔又出兵围困拜占廷城市科尔松(现苏联赫尔松)，拜占廷被迫履约。公元938年，弗拉基
米尔加入东正教并把它定为国教。他用武力强迫基辅居民在第聂伯河畔接受希腊教土洗礼，
把基辅主神佩伦像抛进河中，其余神像悉加焚毁。人们哭天喊地，变成了基督徒。接着各地
居民也被迫受洗。有的地方以暴力反抗，但终被制服。大批拜占廷教士被请来传教，工匠画
师被请来修建教堂。经过一百多年，罗斯人绝大多数终于成为虔诚的基督徒。东正教对俄罗
斯人的政治经济生活和精神文化许多世纪里一直具有重大影响。拜占廷灭亡后，世界东正教
就以俄罗斯为中心。<br><br>
   
 降而复升<br><br>

过了900多年漫长岁月，历史来到转折关头，拥有近一亿教徒的俄罗斯东正教，遇到十
月革命的巨大冲击，势力急剧下降。室第二次世界大战前夕，俄萝斯正教徒不及原数十分之一，
造成下降的原因是多方面的。十月革命后初期，人民群众在推翻剥削阶级统治时打倒那些身穿
僧侣长袍的农奴主和压迫人民的神职人员，教会失去昔日作为剥削阶级统治机构一部分的地
位，思想影响减弱，信徒随之减少。苏维埃政权实行教会同国家、学校同教会分离，宗教成为私
人的事情，公民享有信教或不信教均可的自由，不像过去那样在社会、学校，家庭压力下非
信不可。苏联人民文化水平大大提高，全国大力开展马克思列宁主义和无神论宣传教育。信
教的老一代人去世，不信教的新一代人成长。这些原因造成的宗教影响下降是正常的，合
乎历史规律的。但是，苏联在宗教事务方面也犯了许多错误，主要是“左”倾错误，急于消除
宗教，特别在斯大林时期。戈尔巴乔夫指出了这点，他在1988年4月29日接见俄罗斯正教领袖
时说：“个人迷信时期的悲剧性事件也伤害了教会组织”。这种悲剧性事件所造成的宗教影
响下降，是不符合社会发展规律的。大批教徒表面上不再参与宗教活动，暗地里照样进行，
各种宗教都成立地下教会组织，如“真东正教基督徒”、“沉默运动”、“游行派”、“暗
中派”等等。尽管有广泛的无神论教育，宗教活动受到许多限制，苏联宗教从六十年代起却
开始回升，信徒越来越多。由于苏联人口统计表向来不列宗教信仰这――项，我们无法掌握近
年来苏联信教的人数。西方估计，近年苏联东正教徒约7，000万，伊斯兰教徒约4，500万，天
主教徒约400万，新教徒约300万，犹太教徒约200万，佛教徒近50万，共12，100万人，占苏
联人口近半。苏联学者提供的数字低于此数。有的说苏联各教信徒共7，000万，其中5，000万
属正教。按《文学报》1988年5月18日披露的库普佐夫教授的统计，苏联每5个人中有一个教
徒，那末总数应为5，000多万。无论怎么说，信教者在苏联是为数众多的，这点不可否认。
戈尔巴乔夫198s年3月就任总书记后，最初似对宗教问题重要性估计不足。他于1986年2月
在苏共二十七大作的报告没有只字提到宗教事务，只是在提到多民族文化时触及宗教问题。
他说：  “有些文学和艺术作品及科学著作在独特的民族风格的幌子下企图通过田园式的情调
来贩卖与我们的意识形态、社会主义生活方式和科学世界观相抵触的反动的民族主义残余和
宗教残余。”这种语言，跟过去几十年里苏联以前的领导人的口气一模一样。其实，在苏联
宗教远非只是“残余”1而且这里把宗教笼统地说是“反动的”，还和民族主义残余混合在
一起(虽然两者紧密相连，但却是不同性质的问题)，实在是缺乏客观的具体的分析。与此
关联的是，戈尔巴乔夫这一时期对苏联民族问题也估计不足，他在庆祝十月革命七十周年大会
上说：“我们的民族问题已解决”。话音未落，亚美尼亚、立陶宛、阿塞拜疆等地发生了民族
骚乱和冲突。苏共领导自此开始重视民族问题，同时也开始重视宗教事务。这种重视，集中
表现在1988年罗斯受洗一千年纪念活动中。<br><br>
1988年是俄国把基督教内的东正教定为国教一千周年。国际上对此事十分重视。联合国
教科文组织于1987年6月作出决议，号召150个会员国广泛纪念这―具有世界意义的历史事
件。俄罗斯正教会很早就开始准备纪念活动。1988年6月5日，东正教莫斯科和全俄大牧首皮
缅在莫斯科主显节大教堂宣告纪念活动开始，接着进行了十天祈祷活动。在莫斯科其他教
堂，在列宁格勒、基辅、弗拉基米尔、诺夫哥罗德及其他城市也举行了类似活动，教堂钟声
不绝于耳。6月10日在莫斯科大剧院召开了盛大的纪念会。在俄罗斯正教中心、莫斯科的扎
戈尔斯克市的圣谢尔吉三一大修道院举行了地区主教会议，会议通过俄罗斯正教教会管理新
章程，设立以安德烈、奥丽加、丹尼尔命名的三种勋章，还为在阿富汗战死的苏联军人举行
了祷念仪式。在该市还建立了谢尔吉．拉多涅夫斯基(1321―1391，圣三一修道院创建人，
俄罗斯宗教和政治活动家)雕像。在纪念活动开始前，东正教、伊斯兰教，天主教，犹太教
及其他苏联宗教，教派领袖按惯例举行了会晤。<br><br>
参加纪念活动的，除苏联东正教教会人士和成千上万教徒外，还有许多外国来宾。天主
教教皇特派红衣主教暨梵蒂冈国务秘书卡扎洛里前来参加。世界和平理事会主席洛梅什・钱
德拉在纪念会正式开始前向皮缅授予了世界和平理事会最高奖章――约理奥・居理和平奖章。
教会之所以能这样大张旗鼓地举办纪念活动，是与苏联党政领导的重视和支持分不开
的。戈尔巴乔夫在其1987年11月出版的《改革与新思维》一书中就说：，d1988年将纪念基督
教传入我们祖先的土地上一千年”。1988年4月29日，戈尔巴乔夫接见了以皮缅为首的六位俄
罗斯东正教领导人，进行了90分钟谈话。他指出：  “基督教传入罗斯，不仅有宗教意义，而
且有社会政治意义。它是我国许多世纪历史、文化、俄罗斯国家的发展的重要里程碑”。
6月13日，戈尔巴乔夫接见了梵蒂冈红衣主教卡扎洛里，接受了他递交的教皇保罗二世的私
人信件。这是苏联建国以来国家领导人第一次会见梵蒂冈高级代表。6月11日，葛罗米柯接
见了参加纪念活动的国内外代表，进行了长时间的谈话，他说罗斯受洗是“世界的，欧洲
的、当然也是我们祖国的重大事件”，对俄国“政治、经济、教育、家庭和生活产生了巨大
影响”。苏联最高苏维埃主席团和俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃主席团分别向苏联东正教一批主要
领导人颁发了劳动红旗勋章，民族友谊勋章和荣誉奖状。苏联部长会议向东正教会发了贺信，
东正教会也向部长会议写了信。苏共中央政治局候补委员，苏联最高苏维埃主席团第一副主
席杰米切夫出席了一系列纪念活动，几次发表讲话。苏联部长会议宗教事务委员会两位前副
主席马卡尔采夫和拉赫曼库洛夫与《文学报》政治观察员举行了圆桌座谈，该报5月18日发表
了座谈详细记录。<br><br>
苏联学术界舆论界对纪念活动也十分重视。早在1986年3月苏联科学院就召开了俄国东正
教问题学术讨论会。1987年，思想出版社出版了集体编写的专著《基督教传入罗斯》，填补了
俄国文化史中与此有关的一系列空白点。《共产党人》、《星火》、《真理报》、《消息报》、
《文学报》、《莫斯科周报》等报刊都发表了纪念文章。还举办了音乐会、美术展览会等等。
  不难看出，这次大规模纪念活动，并不是单纯的宗教活动，而是一次爱国主义的社会文
化活动，同时具有团结国内外各宗教教会和教徒的政治意义，是苏联新思维在宗教事务方面
的亮相。<br><br>

  提高评价<br><br>

罗斯受洗，本是论述极多的老议题，1988年纪念活动中又加以论述，有些是旧话重提，
但有些却表现出新意：<br><br>
首先，强调了东正教与俄罗斯关系的深远。关于基督教在被定为国教之前到底在什么时
候传入罗斯，说法原不一致。有的说得比较笼统，如诺索夫主编的《苏联简史》中写道：“基
督教在基辅早有所闻。传说奥丽加女皇在君士坦丁堡受洗并力促自家的儿子斯维亚托斯拉夫
步其后尘”。有的说基督教是在成为国教之前四百年传入罗斯的，如克雷维列夫所著《宗教
史》中说，罗斯“基督教法在弗拉基米尔以前几百年即已开始，从六世纪起，斯拉夫人不断
袭击拜占廷，因此，他们必定了解在这个国家中盛行的宗教和住在那里的人民的风俗。”还
有一种说法，认为基督教在成为罗斯国教前一千年，即该教形成之初，即巳传入罗斯。俄罗
斯最古老的编年史《往年故事》中写道，使徒安德烈由希腊赴罗马途中绕行北欧各地，到过
基辅和诺夫哥罗德，埋下了基督教的火种。后来伊凡雷帝据此声称：  “我们在基督教成立之
初就接受了它。”这种观点，过去为苏联学者所不取，近年来却获得一些人支持。雷巴科夫
院士指出，斯拉夫人古住宅构造很像早期基督徒庙宇的柱廊形大厅。凯德洛夫根据这一发
现，在1988年6月1日《消息报》上发表文章，提出“《往年故事》中的叙述并非无稽之谈，
在弗拉基米尔登位前一千年，基督教已传播于斯拉夫人中”。<br><br>
以前的苏联著作一般都说，基督教在成为国教前在罗斯的信徒是很少的，而凯德洛夫却
认为很多。劳申巴赫院士也在《共产党人》杂志1987年第12期上著文认为，在988年前罗斯
居民已经熟悉基督教，罗斯一些城市里早已存在一些不大的基督徒团体，基督教在罗斯原已
有一定的群众基础。   <br><br>
其次，纪念文章与讲话进一步颂扬了弗拉基米尔大公的英明伟大。他敢于在多神教占优
势而且国家不够统一的形势下果断地选择基督教为国教，真是具有远见卓识。他的改革与彼
得一世的改革不相上下，把古俄罗斯多年积贮的潜力解放出来，使国家开始迅猛发展。尤其
难得的是，他在接受基督教时没有受拜占廷摆布，保持了国家的独立自主。拜占廷起初企图通
过基督教控制罗斯，未达到目的后就不愿看到罗斯以基督教为国教，因为对付一个基督教化
(这在当时就是现代化)的国家比对付一个多神教的野蛮的国家困难得多。弗拉基米尔几乎
是强迫拜占廷把基督教“输出”到罗斯来的，这在当时极不容易。民间文学中把弗拉基米尔
称为“红太阳”，他当之无愧。<br><br>
再次，纪念活动中进一步肯定了罗斯受洗在历史。上的多方面意义。一是国际政治意义。
戈尔巴乔夫在《改革与新思维》中指出：  “基督教把古罗斯同欧洲联系起来。”葛罗米
柯说，基督教“把古罗斯纳入了中世纪广阔的国际生活轨道”。劳申巴赫也指出，  “弗拉
基米尔把罗斯引入欧洲基督教国家体系之中。它的国际地位加强了。罗斯遂闻名于世界各角
落”。这些说法都是有针对性的，是为了反驳西方一些人士说苏联不算是真正的欧洲国家的
谬论，强调苏联不但在地理上是欧洲国家，而且在政治，经济，文化传统上都与欧洲其他国
家有源远流长的联系。二是社会经济意义。多神教代表旧的经济关系，适合于氏族制度，基
督教才适合于新生的封建关系。三是文化意义，基督教不但使罗斯全国宗教信仰统一，而且
“使罗斯有可能部分地接受拜占廷文化，出现了石砌建筑，水彩壁画、镶嵌艺术。翻译了许
多宗教的和世俗的文学作品”  (葛罗米柯语)。还应补充一句，俄罗斯笔录文学、绘画都始
于基督教成为国教后，最初都是宗教性的。基督教和拜占廷文化对俄罗斯文化影响很深。在
这次纪念活动中宣传了斯拉夫文字的创制者基里尔和梅福季兄弟对古罗斯文化的贡献。这两
人于九世纪下半期创制了38个斯拉夫字母，其中24个借自希腊文，14个是他们自己构想的，
他们勇敢地反对当时教会关于只能用希腊语、拉丁语，伊夫里特语(以色列国语)三种语言
传教的规定而用斯拉夫语言文字传教，不但使基督教在斯拉夫人中传播，而且遏制了拜占廷
指望凭借希腊语扩展自己势力的野心。过去一些苏联著作对这两人的介绍不够实事求是。有
的只笼统说他们是“斯拉夫传教士”、  “斯拉夫启蒙学者”，不提来自何国，有的虽说他们
是希腊人，却贬低其贡献，如布罗茨基主编的《俄国文学史》说：  “这两个希腊传教士……
仅仅编造了一组更便于使用的字母”。近年来，苏联对这两人评价大大提高。从1986年起，
由穆尔曼斯克市发端，许多城市开展了“斯拉天文字和文化节”活动，纪念两人的历史功
勋。《文学报》1988年5月18日称两人为“伟大的启蒙者”，还转载丁保加利亚作家卡拉斯拉
沃夫题为《感激的节日》的颂扬这两人的文章。劳申巴赫院士在上面提到的文章里也说，弗拉
基米尔之所以能成功地使基督教成为国教，是与基里尔和梅福季的贡献分不开的，现在各斯
拉夫民族都公正地把他们作为“杰出的启蒙家来纪念”。<br><br>
以上各点，都表现出苏联现领导和文化思想界十分重视挖掘自己国家与欧洲各国的共同
处和深远关系，以适应当前加强与国外联系方针的需要。<br><br>
如上所言，人们肯定东正教在罗斯最初起了积极作用。但在后来的漫长历史中，它起了
什么作用呢?是不是总起着消极的乃至反动的作用呢?葛罗米柯在接见宗教界代表时说：
“东正教会在俄国历史一些关键时刻积极参与促进了人民力量的团结，促进了分裂的土地结
成一个统一国家，使它成为欧洲最大的国家。在鞑靼蒙古人统治的时期，东正教会在保卫民
族统一方面作出了贡献。”戈尔巴乔大在接见东正教领袖时则着重谈到东正教徒和教会在苏
联现代史中的作用：“为了实现平等和自由，信教者和不信教者共同实现了历史上第―次社
会主义革命，肩并肩地劳动，缔造着社会主义大厦。在伟大卫国战争年代里，他们共同在前
方浴血奋战，在后方忘我劳动。共同的命运、艰苦的反法西斯保卫社会主义的殊死斗争，团
结了所有人。人们都清楚地记得教会在那严峻的年代里发出的爱国主义号召和开展的筹集国
防基金的群众运动，用教徒的捐款建立了几个以亚历山大・涅夫斯基命名的飞行人队和以德
米特里・顿斯柯伊命名的坦克纵队。”这些历史事实，说明在俄国和苏联历史上，东正教并
不只是起过消极的或反动的作用，也起过部分的积极作用。<br><br>
由此推而广之，一些纪念文章也肯定了基督教乃至整个宗教在历史上对人类的认识和精
神发展发生过一定的积极作用。  《共产党人》杂志1988年第12期发表国家奖金获得者克里班
诺夫博士和米特洛亨博：亡合写的《历史与宗教》一文，指出“宗教是社会历史发展的产物和
体现者，它在思想上的作用是多方面的。对于统治阶级来说，它过去和现在都是精神压迫的
工具，是维护其本身利益的，但同时它也能作为阶级社会反抗和斗争的思想表达方式。”这
是说宗教即可为剥削阶级也可为被剥削阶级服务。文中又说：  “基督教一方面使人成为神的
奴隶，给人造成桎梏，另一方面也使人获得一定的精神解脱和自由。”  “基督教及其‘对抽
象人的崇拜’(马克思语)提出了一整套新的精神价值标准和方向体系，它在人和上帝之间建
立了一种直接的和双向的联系，使人的精神世界获得一些自由，使人的个性表现合法化。”
这种把信教与获得精神自由联系起来的观点，在苏联是新颖的。  “基督教之所以能摆脱地区
狭隘性而成为世界性宗教，是因为它在对待各族人民时不论其民族、宗教和地位如何，在对
待个人时也不问其属于何家族种族，原来信奉何教，是自由人或非自由人，总之，按人那样对
待”。这里强调了基督教的平等观。“宗教不只是荒谬，历史上许多科学概念，社会伦理范畴
和价值，最初都是用宗教语言以通俗易懂的形式表达出来的。这种外壳是合乎历史规律的，
在人类的精神发展史上是必然的。”这段话强调子宗教在历史上对科学的贡献。<br><br>
纪念活动中着重阐述宗教和教会过去起过而又被埋没了的积极作用，当然不意味论者们
忘掉了“宗教是人民的鸦片”这样一些马克思主义宗教原理，而是为了更全面更准确地掌
握、阐发这些原理，同时在新形势下发展这些原理。<br><br>

  历史反思<br><br>

两年来，苏联对党的政策及其实施情况的历史作了反思。参照《共产党人》杂志1988年
第4期未署名文章《社会主义与宗教》及其他文章，十月革命以来苏联的宗教工作可分为四
个阶段。  <br><br>
第一阶段是列宁时期。列宁撰写了一系列有关论文，亲自起草或主持制订了一系列基本
的宗教政策，为后来苏联整个宗教工作奠定了坚实的基础，如《关于教会同国家分离和学校
同教会分离》、俄共(布)八大(1919年3月)通过的纲领中有关宗教问题的条文、俄共
(布)十二大(1923年4月)关于进行反宗教的宣传鼓动工作的决议等。这些法令取消了教
会的一切特权，肯定了宗教信仰自由，宣告了宗教是教徒私人的事情(这本是德国社会民主
党爱尔福特纲领中一个著名条文)，同时在全国大力开展无神论宣传，但列宁从未宣布俄国
是无神论国家，他反对任何对宗教开战的冒险行为。列宁在《论工人政党对宗教的态度》一文
中指出：  “我们应该同宗教作斗争。这是整个唯物主义的起码原则。但是马克思主义不是停
留在起码原则上的唯物主义。马克思主义更前进了一步。它认为必须善于同宗教作斗争，为
此要善于用唯物主义观点来说明群众信仰宗教的根源。”他在《社会主义和宗教》中又说：
“我们要求教会同国家完全分离，用纯粹的思想武器，而且仅仅是思想武器，用我们的书
刊，我们的言论来跟宗教迷雾进行斗争。”列宁的思想是正确而且明确的，在实践中也基本
得到贯彻。东正教会大多数领导人最初反对苏维埃政权，后来有改变。全俄牧首吉洪就曾因
参加反苏维埃活动而被捕，后来悔过自新，重新担任教职。<br><br>
第二阶段是二十至三十年代斯大林个人迷信形成时期。这一阶段宗教工作中“左”倾思
想严重。斯大林一方面宣传了列宁的宗教政策，另一方面又对教会人士全盘否定。他在1931
年12月和德国作家艾米尔・路德维希谈话，路德维希问他，  “难道你不承认耶稣教会有好的
品质吗?”斯大林答道：  “是的，为了实现丑恶的目的，他们在工作中是有一贯性和顽强性
的。但是，他们的基本方法是监视、间谍活动，刺探情况和侮辱人，这里能有什么是好的
呢?”斯大林在这里讲的虽主要是他上过的一所格鲁吉亚正教中学，但明显地带有对教会人
士普遍指责的意思，人们更是把他的话当作普遍真理来接受。由于斯大林“左”倾思想的影
响，在集体化时期到处都把信教与犯罪等同起来，宗教被列入应该而且可以迅速消灭的资本
主义残余，教徒形同潜在的敌人，教会组织被看作敌对组织，迫害教会人士和教徒被看成社
会主义改造的组成部分，教堂被关闭甚至化为废墟，神像在火堆中燃烧，成千上万神父被押
往集中营和流放地。1929年成立全苏“战斗的无神论者同盟”，这是个群众性的进行科学无
神论宣传的组织，鼎盛时会员达300万，支部9．6万个，他们一方面进行了大量有益工作，也
反对过对宗教的“左”倾行为，但另一方面他们的行为有许多也是过火偏激的。<br><br>
第三阶段是卫国战争及其后时期。战时，教会人士和广大教徒表现出空前的爱国热情。
党组织和非教徒们认识到，教会人士和广大教徒也能为社会主义祖国、为苏维埃政权牺牲生
命，作出贡献；不能把教徒与非教徒对立起来。于是斯大林于1941年解散了“战斗的无神论
者同盟”，1943年同意东正教恢复牧首制和一些教会组织。东正教获得转机。<br><br>
卫国战争胜利后和赫鲁晓夫执政时期，教会势力活跃，无神论的宣传工作一度削弱。苏
共中央1954年作出《关于科学无神论宣传中的重大缺点及其改进措施》决议，要求各地坚决
消除对宗教的消极态度，揭露宗教的反动本质及其由于使部分公民不能自觉地和积极地参加
共产主义建设所造成的危害，反宗教工作必须不断地进行，要有极大的顽强性，要采取说
服、耐心解释以及对其教徒个别做工作的方法。这一决议取得了一定效果，加强了无神论宣
传教育工作。但教会的合法活动又遇到障碍，这在勃列日涅夫执政时期加剧，许多地方官员
给教会活动制造困难，地方教会组织取得合法地位不易，教徒被看作二等公民。<br><br>
宗教工作中主要问题是“左”倾错误，而较彻底地纠正这方面的“左”倾错误，
整个经济、政治工作中的“左”倾错误深入时才有可能。<br><br>
1985年3月后苏联开始全面改革，贯彻新思维。但宗教事务方面的转变，应该说是始自
1988年纪念罗斯受洗一千年的活动，它标志苏联政府宗教工作第四阶段的开端。苏联政府
坚持列宁制订的宗教政策和无神论宣传教育，同时强调要清醒地看到宗教存在的长期性和反
宗教斗争的艰巨性，反对急躁冒进，苏联报刊指出，过去往往掩盖真象，说国内信教者越来
越少，真实相反。令人深思的是，现在的信教者除个别例外都是在十月革命后、在唯物主义
和无神论教育环境下生长起来的，大多受过中等乃至高等教育。据刘宗次同志在苏联小说
《阿尔巴特街的儿女》中译本前言中说，他认识的一位研究小说诗学的苏联学者加入了东正
教，其三个孙子也受了洗；他在莫斯科教堂里见到了相当数量的中年知识分子。<br><br>  
其所以发生这种情况，苏联学者认为，一是社会原因。长期以来苏联存在着大量破坏社
会主义准则的严重现象，腐败、官僚主义、对人民利益冷淡、滥杀滥捕无辜……这些都导致
人民对生活的失望和信仰危机，人们转向宗教道德探索，希望从宗教中获得答案和慰藉。二
是宗教能量。宗教代代相传，已在人们心理和习俗中根深蒂固，与民族性结合，不易改变，
而当代教会又颇能适应时代与社会的特点，东正教会传教的重点已不在天国而在建立人间乐
园，能够满足社会主义社会人们从别的方面得不到的精神需要，也能够在一般情况下与社会
主义道德准绳一致。现在的东正教组织与教徒绝大多数都是爱国守法的，教徒都是劳：动人．
民。戈尔巴乔夫在接见东正教领袖时指出，  “信教者是苏维埃人，是劳动人民，是爱国者，他
们完全有权适当地表现自己的信仰”，因而党和政府“必须现实地考虑现有的形势”。 <br><br>
文学报 1988年5月18日还专门发表一篇报道，介绍一位45岁的女集体农庄庄员索菲亚・彼得
洛夫娜，她是虔诚的东正教徒，也是优秀的饲养员，在村里备受尊敬。既然实际如此，那
末，正如苏联宗教事务委员会前副主席拉赫曼库洛夫在上面提到的圆桌座谈中所说，加快宗
教消亡的企图不仅是错误的，而且是有害的，不允许再把信教的同胞看成二等公民，不允许
再对宗教合法活动制造障碍，应当永远结束对教徒及其所宣扬的人道、爱、道德自我完善等
观念敌对的态度。<br><br>
在变更认识的基础上，苏联领导对东正教会的合理要求给予了满足。在这次纪念活动中
给予了物质支持。政府决定把著名的基辅洞窟修道院的一部分、奥普塔圣母进堂小修道院和
托尔格修道院划归东正教会支配。<br><br>
苏联政府正在制订新的宗教法律，其内容尚不得而知，但可以预料，它将保证教会在法
律范围内正常活动并在改革中进一步发挥作用。戈尔巴乔夫说；“绝大多数信教者都接受改
革，他们为实现社会经济加速发展的计划，为发展民主与公开性做了不少贡献。”苏联最高
苏维埃第一副主席杰米切夫一再说，希望教会“努力在改革过程中找到自己的位置”。东正
教会领导人也多次表示对改革的支持。皮缅说，东正教要热烈祈祷改革成功并为改革竭尽全
力。他们做的工作大致有：①向信徒进行拥护改革的教育。②向信徒进行道德教育。皮缅表
示，“教会要尽力对信徒进行道德教育，在他们心中树立人的尊严，巩固家庭的神圣性，培
养认真的劳动态度，以造福于他人和整个社会，”③开展社会福利活动，东正教会近年设立
的文化基金、列宁儿童基金，“祖国”协会、国际主义战士康复中心等等，都是配合社会改
革的产物。④进行国际交往，与国外宗教组织共同开展争取国际和平，争取裁军和销毁核武
器、反对战争的活动。戈尔巴乔夫在接见皮缅等人时特别强调这一点，他说：“人类的最高
利益是生活在世界上根本不用害怕将来会爆发核战争；能对自己子孙的未来放心。我们希望
在努力实现这个目标时能得到教会支持，希望教会在保卫和平的事业中采取新的步骤。<br><br>
在谈到宗教事务时，也谈到要坚持和加强无神论宣传教育工作。但没有做出加强无神论
宣传的新的决议。一些文章指出，过去的无神论教育工作虽有成绩，但缺点也明显，无神论
书籍绝大多数停留在普及水平和枯燥说教上，只宣传宗教的危害，解释不了当代生活中的宗
教现象。亟需改进科学无神论教育体系，要解答一些迫切的关键性的理论性问题。无神论宣传
者既应有世界观的坚定性，又应能理解和体贴信教者。无神论宣传教育不能导致破坏宗教法
律。苏联宗教事务委员会副主席指出：“哪里对政府的宗教信仰法令遵守得更好，哪里的无
神论教育工作才能更有成效。”<br><br>
综上所述，戈尔巴乔夫在全面改革中纠正了苏联多年对宗教“左”倾的态度，或用他自己
的话说，“完全恢复列宁对宗教、教会和信教者的态度”，对宗教采取了承认现实、肯定贡
献、放宽发展、适当支持、因势利导、依法治理、发挥作用的方针，利用罗斯受洗一千年纪
念活动这一时机做了东正教的工作，并以此影响其他宗教和教会。应该看到，几十年来教会
也有不少问题，其违法组织和活动遭到禁止是合理的。在宗教事务贯彻新思维后，也会出现
新的问题和矛盾，有的还可能激化一时，特别在非俄罗斯人中。但总的趋向是，这样做能进
一步调动教会与教徒为社会和改革服务的积极性，能增进全国团结，有利于共产主义的到
来，到那时宗教存在的社会物质基础消失了，宗教自然会减弱以至消失，用不着现在着急。

 天主教教皇弗朗西斯和东正教普世牧首巴塞洛缪在耶路撒冷教堂共同祷告<br><br>

2014-05-26 
<br><br>

据环球网转引美国《基督教科学箴言报》今日（5月26日）报道，5月25日，罗马教皇弗朗西斯（Pope Fracis）和东正教普世牧首巴塞洛缪（Bartholomew）在耶路撒冷的教堂一同进行祷告。此举或意在弥合两教派数百年来的裂痕。<br><br>
朗西斯（1936-）和巴塞洛缪（1940-）在圣墓教堂（Church of the Holy Sepulchre）外的庭院内互相拥抱，随后进入教堂共同祷告。该教堂被两教认为是耶稣受迫害、埋葬和重生的地方。此次会面具有许多象征意义：两位均年过七十的教宗手挽手走下通往教堂的石阶，而弗朗西斯在巴塞洛缪的演讲结束后俯身亲吻了他的手，此举被认为是为补偿五百年前一位东正教主因被迫亲吻天主教皇的脚而蒙受的侮辱。
<br><br>
弗朗西斯表示，他此行来到巴勒斯坦及以色列地区的首要目的，便是纪念天主教皇保罗六世和东正领袖雅典那哥拉会面五十周年。两位教主1964年的一个拥抱，结束了1054年基督教大分裂后两教长达九百年的疏远和隔阂。那次见面后，两个教派建立了更亲密的联系，甚至发起了积极的对话，但核心价值观的巨大差异仍然存在，其中包括大主教职位的归属。<br><br>
弗朗西斯称东正教信徒为天主教的“兄弟”，而巴塞洛缪也表达了用爱化解恐惧、极端主义和憎恨的倡议。他说：“我们在耶稣被埋葬的地方相见想传递的信息只有一个：用爱包容他人，包容与我们有着不同信仰的人们。”<br><br>

保禄六世(Paul VI)，（1897年9月26日－1978年8月6日）<br><br>

Athenagoras I , born Aristocles Spyrou was the 268th Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 1948 to 1972.<br><br>

The controversial declaration did not end the 1054 schism, but rather showed a desire for greater reconciliation between the two churches, as represented by Pope Paul VI and Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I. Not all Orthodox leaders, however, received the declaration with joy. Metropolitan Philaret of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad openly challenged the Patriarch's efforts at rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church fearing it would lead to heresy, in his 1965 epistle to the Patriarch.<br><br>

东正教与大牧首<br><br>

东正教又称正教、希腊正教、东方正教，是基督教中的一个派别，主要是指依循由东罗马帝国（又称“拜占庭帝国”）所流传下来的基督教传统的教会，它是与天主教、基督新教并立的基督教三大派别之一。<br><br>

东正教不承认罗马教皇的权威和领导，它自设牧首区，牧首区下辖数个首府主教区。主教区首脑为主教，东正教各牧首区承认君士坦丁堡牧首为“普世教会牧首”，是教会的精神领袖。但这仅仅是一个荣誉地位，普世牧首并不对其他牧首区具有任何实际的领导权。<br><br>

东正教一直没有统一的全球性的教会首脑机构。名义上君士坦丁堡（即今伊斯坦布尔）大牧首处于首席地位，但实际上莫斯科大牧首、耶路撒冷大牧首、安提阿大牧首、亚力山大里亚大牧首并不受其节制，而且这些大牧首对非本国的正教会辖区的影响也很有限。<br><br>
