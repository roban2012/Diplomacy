	<br><br>To what extent do you agree with the statement: “Company politics trump evidence in decision-making”?<br><br>

<a href="http://www.retter2012.com/">Retter is Better</a>, WE Create and Deliver Real Value!<br><br>

	An organisation’s ability to make decisions effectively
underpins everything from operations to strategy.<br><br>
And yet, decision-making in business management is
poorly understood and rarely discussed explicitly.<br><br>
This report, written by The Economist Intelligence
Unit and sponsored by Applied Predictive
Technologies (APT), examines how businesses really
make decisions, and how they can improve their
decision-making capabilities. It finds that businesses
should address both the information decision-makers
have available to them, and the organisational context
in which decisions are made.<br><br>
