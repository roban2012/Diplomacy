China’s global personality
China’s ‘global personality’ C the interaction between its identity and foreign and security policy
approaches C cannot be reduced to any single overriding concept. It is complex and dynamic, and
features multiple layers. It is also in a period of flux, magnified by a sense (especially among Chinese
elites) of global shifts in traditional economic balance and political power.
The ambiguity and evolution are reflected in debates in China around the implications of its rise for its
traditional identity as a developing country, whether it should become more ‘revisionist’ in seeking to
change international or regional order, and how assertive its foreign and security policy should be.
There is also debate about the nature of China’s complex and changing global environment.
China is not the only driver of change in its global personality. Perceptions and policy choices by other
countries that are global actors are important, especially the United States and Japan. The United
States remains the single most important of these, and discussion of its policy choices has so far
dominated the (non-Chinese) literature about the ‘rise of China’.
Influencing perceptions of and the discourse about China is part of Beijing’s diplomatic challenge, but
the spread overseas of Chinese commercial and individual interests makes this more difficult. Longerterm
implications of China’s rise depend on the interactions not just between strategic and tactical
decisions made by the Chinese and other governments, but also arising from the global political and
economic impact of Chinese non-state actors.
The underlying context is uncertainty about the extent and impact of the rise of China, which so far is
greater at a regional than global level, China’s economic size is not yet matched by its diplomatic and
other influence, and its rapid but uneven development has created new domestic risks. Still, China’s
global influence has spread substantially. In the country itself, the idea that it has become a major
power has become stronger.

	<b><a name="T2">Foreign and security policy under new leadership</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

The Chinese leadership in place since 2012 has introduced a number of innovations in foreign and
security policy, including the idea of building a new type of major-power relationship with the United
States and changes to the style of diplomacy. The establishment of a new National Security Commission
is significant and not limited to foreign policy: it looks likely to strengthen policy coordination and
integration across relevant domestic and external issues.
Engagement with the existing international order remains strong. But there is a growing element of
gradual revisionism in Chinese policy-making towards elements of regional and international order.
This involves an emphasis on the United Nations as the primary international institution for addressing
global issues. China will continue to pursue a more active international role, such as through UN
peacekeeping missions, but remains reluctant to offer support at the UN for intervention in problem
areas around the world.	
Geographically, China’s primary policy focus will be on relations with the United States and in Asia. The
new leadership has also emphasized strategic relations with Russia. Europe has been less of a priority,
but is still considered a major power. China’s ‘omni-directional diplomacy’ underpins its growing
engagement across all continents.
The new type of major-power relationship with the United States is intended to avoid conflict between
it and a rising China, and to develop into a relationship characterized by equality, including in Asia. It
remains to be seen how feasible this is, which will depend partly on US responses and partly on how far
the Chinese leadership chooses to test the United States’ ‘bottom line’ (e.g. through the November 2013
announcement of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the East China Sea).
This is related to the development of firmer or more assertive Chinese policy in Asia in recent years.
However, current uncertainty in East Asia should be seen not simply as the result of China’s rise and
others’ responses to it, but also as a consequence of the ongoing renegotiation of regional order by
many regional actors.
China’s relationship with Japan is likely to remain poor. However, it remains strategically important to
China, though its precise objectives are unclear. The state of the relationship is also intimately linked to
the renegotiation of regional order.
There is little prospect of significant change in policy towards the Korean peninsula. Southeast Asian
countries have sought to ensure US security engagement and assurances, but they do not want to
become entirely dependent on it and need to maintain good relations with China. Organizations such as
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are important for these countries in ensuring their
voice is heard in the region.
China will continue to engage in multilateral institutions, especially those with an economic focus.
Regionally, there is a preference for institutions that are limited in scope to East Asia rather than the
Asia-Pacific, although it is likely to remain engaged with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, East
Asia Summit, ASEAN Regional Forum and ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting Plus. China sees US-led
initiatives such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership as efforts to renegotiate elements of international order, but it will seek to join the TPP in
due course if the institution takes off.
International governance on cyber security is an interesting test case for Chinese policy, given that it is
being developed at a time of China’s rise. An important part of the Chinese approach is promoting the
idea of ‘sovereign virtual territory’, and ideally seeking consensus on new rules under the United
Nations.

	<b><a name="T3">Policy implications</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

The implications of China’s rise will be affected by the choices made not just in the country, but
elsewhere. Subject to the constraints of relative power and influence in the international system, there
is therefore space for other countries to engage in shaping the future global and regional order.

The policy choices of the United States and Chinese responses to them will have the greatest impact.
China has shown little interest in the idea that it might develop some sort of ‘G2’ structure with the
United States for oversight of global affairs, and currently its main strategic aim for this relationship is
to avoid a negative spiral. Other countries should also try to influence the direction of USCChinese
relations.
Different layers and ambiguity in China’s global personality imply different behaviours in different
contexts. A coherent and logically consistent approach may not emerge across issues, meaning policymakers
will need to deal with each separately.
If strategic difficulties in the USCChinese relationship continue, these could pose particular challenges
for other countries whose strategic interests have been aligned closely with the United States, but for
which the rise of China may offer as many opportunities as threats. Dealing with these dilemmas
requires innovative assessments of national interest: at issue are relationships not just with China but
with the United States, and questions of regional order and governance.

	<hr><br>
	
This paper examines the drivers and implications of China’s evolving ‘global personality’, understood as
the interaction between its identity and foreign and security policy approaches. It identifies likely
Chinese policy approaches to a number of specific issues, and then briefly outlines some possible
scenarios, discussing the policy implications for developed countries outside the region (other than the
United States).
The paper argues that China’s global personality is complex and dynamic. It is currently in a period of
flux, driven by debates within China that are magnified by a global context that is also characterized by
a period of shifts in traditional economic balance and political power. The main debates are around the
implications of China’s rise for its traditional identity as a developing country, whether it should
become more ‘revisionist’ in seeking to change the international and regional orders, and how assertive
its foreign and security policy should be. There is also debate about how benign, or otherwise, China’s
changing and complex external environment is.
This period of flux not only creates ambiguity, but also opens up a range of possible scenarios for the
development of Chinese approaches to global issues, reflecting a complex intertwining of economic,
traditional and non-traditional security matters, and domestic politics. As a result, generalizations that
are often used by various actors to describe Chinese approaches C such as ‘assertive’, ‘peaceful’,
‘cooperative’, ‘disruptive’ C do not do justice to the reality of Chinese policy-making. Instead Chinese
behaviour varies across issues, so each one must be looked at on its own terms.
China is not the only actor or driver of change. Its global personality is partly the result of the way its
behaviour is perceived, though these perceptions may not fully take into account the complex nature of
its internal processes, actors and systems, which inform the behaviour that China displays on the
international stage. Further, identity is relational, and the policy choices and behaviour of other
regional powers C especially the United States and Japan C influence China’s global personality and
have direct implications for the evolution of regional order in East Asia. Indeed, viewing developments
in Asia as part of an ongoing process of renegotiating regional order (rather than simply a question of
China’s rise and responses to it) provides a more fruitful framework to take account of change in others’
approaches as well as in China’s.
When it comes to policy implications, the dynamics of China’s evolving global personality have the
potential for creating ongoing difficulties in the USCChinese relationship, and therefore posing
particular challenges for other developed countries whose strategic interests have traditionally been
close to those of the United States, but for which the growing economic and commercial clout of China
may offer as many opportunities as threats. (This may also apply in some diplomatic and nontraditional
security areas.) Dealing with these dilemmas requires innovative assessments of national
interest on the part of these countries: identifying where the greatest threats to national security lie,
what sort of ‘alliances’ are most beneficial in this changing world, and what sort of global governance
structures these countries might aspire to be part of. At issue is their relationship not just with China
but also with the United States, and questions of regional order and governance.

	<b><a name="T5">What is China’s ‘global personality’?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
To draw out the value of the concept of ‘global personality’, this paper looks at the way in which a
number of policy approaches interact with conceptions of China’s identity, particularly self-identity.
These cover the shaping of China’s positions in multilateral forums, on international peace and security
issues; its relations with other global and regional powers, in particular its relations with other BRICS
countries (i.e. Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa) and the United States (including the meaning of
‘new kind of great-power relationship’); and its positions on cyber issues.
However, a discussion of China’s global personality should start by thinking about what is ‘China’ in
this context. As the literature on China’s rise makes clear, its global impact has not been solely the
result of actions by the government or other official organs.1 It is therefore necessary to draw a
distinction between ‘official’ and ‘unofficial’ China. The impact of Chinese people and businesses on
other societies has been increasingly significant, whether through overseas investment by companies,
growth in tourism or student numbers overseas, with sometimes relatively limited official control.2
These unofficial dynamics in China’s global interactions have a clear impact on how its ‘personality’
might be conceived elsewhere. Perhaps because of assumptions that China’s political system is
monolithic and authoritarian, there is a tendency for all Chinese actors to be subsumed under the term
‘China’ (e.g. in newspaper headlines such as ‘China buys xyz …’ to describe an acquisition by a Chinese
company), conflating all of this activity into ‘official China’, at least by implication. Conceptually,
therefore, the idea of China’s global personality should cover a broad range of actors. This noted, given
the policy focus here, this paper concentrates most of its analysis on ‘official China’.
The idea of ‘personality’ is a powerful one, though International Relations studies tend to talk more
about state ‘behaviour’ than ‘personality’.3 An example is Suisheng Zhao’s characterization of China’s
‘strategic personality’ as ‘pragmatic’.4 In contrast, Edward Luttwak applies a concept of ‘great power
autism’ to China, using this to account for what he describes as ‘a pronounced insensitivity to foreign
sensitivities’,5 a tendency that, he concludes, leads to greater tension, and maybe even conflict, between
China and other countries, especially its neighbours. Others highlight changes in behaviour and how
this feeds back into the structures that then inform future policy (this being the thinking behind the
idea of ‘socializing’ states to international norms).6

Beyond language of ‘personality’ and ‘behaviour’, though, questions of identity are central to the
mainstream study of state behaviour in international relations. Behind this lies an ongoing debate
about the nature of identity, with constructivists arguing against realists that that identity is not given,
but is ‘what states make of it’.7 This conceptual framework opens up analytical space not only for
countries themselves (or different actors within them) to have conceptualizations of national identity
that vary over time, but also for actors in other countries to have different perceptions of that country’s
identity (and interests). As Gilbert Rozman says, ‘National identities are existential and relational.’8
Seeing national identity as relational, not ‘essential’, does not mean that identity is arbitrary or without
historical roots. Elements of China’s global personality are constructed on the basis of its elites’
understanding of behaviour over the longue durée and the implications of the twentieth-century
revolutions and their aftermath. These elements include a clear sense that China was historically a great
power, a sense of victimhood resulting from imperial incursions and invasions from the mid-nineteenth
century through the Second World War,9 and a ‘post-colonial’ sentiment in the People’s Republic
reflected, for example, in the ‘five principles of peaceful coexistence’ set out by Zhou Enlai in the
1950s.10 They also reflect the complex nature of its internal processes and systems. Some of these
elements are highlighted further below.
The question of China’s current identity is a complex, contested and dynamic one, with important
implications for policy choices by the Chinese leadership and by others who deal with China.

The directions of Chinese policy and its implications
Many Chinese official presentations on the country’s foreign policy or approaches to international
affairs begin with analysis of the global context. These tend to emphasize that:
-- the global situation is complex, especially following the global financial crisis (with some ambiguity
over whether the crisis has ended);
-- global affairs and the international order are in a state of flux; and
-- one feature of this is the growth of a number of emerging powers, part of an ‘inevitable’ trend
towards multipolarity.11
As one former Chinese official put it, the world is in a period of ‘substantial global change’, with
‘adjustment in international relations’.12 While many identify this with changes in relative power
between states, or between a ‘rising south and falling north’,13 others highlight the impact of non-state
actors and non-traditional security challenges.14 Below the official level, there is important debate
among Chinese experts about how benign, or otherwise, China’s external environment is, and this
analysis frames thinking on international affairs.
The global context is also relevant because, given strong worldwide interest in China, the regime itself is
not always in control of how its ‘personality’ is perceived or constructed. One consequence of this is that
Chinese policy-makers see the need to influence discourse about China as part of the diplomatic
challenge they face.15 The rapid rise of China means that this dynamic is much more present in its case
than in that of any other country. Part of the reason for the limited ability of the Chinese authorities to
control how the country’s personality is perceived is the growing impact of the global spread of Chinese
corporate interests and individual travellers. Chinese companies are particularly perceived as
representing China abroad, though often they are outside the control of China’s officialdom.16
While it is change in China that has attracted most attention over recent decades, starting by thinking
about the global context raises questions of agency by effectively placing the dynamism and source of
change at the global level. A framework that allows us to incorporate change in the approaches of other
actors, whether the US ‘rebalance’ to Asia, shifts in Japanese security policy,17 or changes at a regional
or global level, is offered by Evelyn Goh.18 She argues that the period since the end of the Cold War has
witnessed the establishment and ongoing transformation of US hegemony in East Asia, at the same
time as and partly as the result of China’s rise. For Goh, the key dynamic is an ‘order transition’, an
ongoing renegotiation among states of the region’s norms and institutions.19 She concludes that this has resulted (for the moment at least) in a ‘layered hierarchy’ with the United States at its peak, followed by
China. This emphasis on order is in contrast to a ‘power transition’, which focuses on the material
capabilities of states, and it may explain the extent of uncertainty and apparent transformation in East
Asia, even at a time when the majority of material indicators continue to show that the United States
remains well ahead of China.
In contrast, much of the literature commenting on Chinese foreign and security policy implicitly or
explicitly assumes a more constant regional order and US position in it, which policy-makers and
scholars refer to as a regional ‘status quo’. This concept may be deceptive and potentially dangerous for
policy-makers,20 but much of the literature reflects this assumption. In these dominant perspectives,
regional change and challenge come from China’s ‘rise’, effectively making it the agent of change.
Still, the most significant underlying phenomenon is China’s emergence from the late twentieth century
as a major force in global affairs, a process that has intensified over the last few years.21 A bald set of
statistics can be cited to support this claim: in 2010 China became the second largest economy in the
world in aggregate terms, it is the largest holder of foreign exchange reserves, it is the largest trader of
goods as of 2013, and so on. A small number of commentators continue to see China’s rise as some sort
of mirage, supported by statistical sleight of hand, which will sooner or later lead to a coming collapse.
At the other end of the spectrum is the idea of China inevitably emerging as the next global superpower,
symbolized by its impending overtaking of the United States as the world’s largest economy as
measured by aggregate GDP, and possibly at some point to ‘rule the world’. The assumption in this
paper is short of this, but it assumes that, at the very least, the increase of China’s share of world
income (from 2.2 per cent in 1980 to 14.4 per cent in 2011)22 marks a major shift in the country’s global
weight. That China’s rise has had a major global impact is a ‘basic fact of today’s world’.23
Nevertheless, the actual extent and impact of this shift remain the subject of debate, and the literature
identifies important limits to China’s power and influence. These analyses fall into several broad
schools, with overlap between them. First, there is the idea that China’s rise to date is primarily as a
regional power, not a global one. Second is the argument that China’s economic influence may have
increased substantially as its economy has grown, but that this has not been matched by diplomatic,
cultural and soft power, and military influence. Third, there are accounts that emphasize the risks
inherent in the way in which China’s development has taken place, from political strains and challenges
to social stability, to what Mel Gurtov calls the ‘Achilles’ heel’ of environmental damage.24
David Shambaugh draws on many of these themes to argue that the world has witnessed not so much
the ‘rise’ of China as the ‘spread’ across the globe, but without much depth, of China’s commercial, social and political influence.25 He concludes that China’s power has often been dramatically
overstated: it remains a ‘partial power’. However, Shambaugh also shows how the debate about
whether China is (yet) a ‘great power’ is reflected within China as well as outside the country, and he
identifies a dominant Chinese discourse in which ‘China is a major world power C or at least is well on
the way to becoming one’, arguing that the debate has since shifted to discuss ‘what kind of major
power China should be’.26 The idea that, irrespective of judgments about the country’s actual global
influence, the debate within China about its global identity has moved into a new phase is an important
one. Shaun Breslin comments that the sense of ‘victimhood’ that has long been an important part of
contemporary Chinese identity is seen by some in China as diminishing while a sense of the country as
a ‘great power’ becomes stronger.27
A further, more recent, element in discussions of China’s rise comes from English School approaches
that inform Evelyn Goh’s framework (see above). The argument here is that hegemonic succession is
not just material, but encompasses norms and legitimacy. These have not (yet) been features of China’s
rise (hence perhaps the Chinese leadership’s keenness on developing ‘soft power’).28 Therefore a
hegemonic transition, or succession, between the United States and China is highly unlikely at the
moment. As Ian Clark puts it, ‘any accretion of China’s economic power, let alone a more general
tendency towards multipolarity, does not even begin to translate into a hegemonic succession.’29
This discussion is important analytically and for policy-makers in assessing the relative importance that
should be accorded to China. While there are important limitations to China’s rise, some words of
caution are in order. If anything, there has been a tendency over recent decades C both from ‘China
watchers’ and perhaps from elites in China, as demonstrated by the surprise at the way China was
thrust into the driving seat of responses to the global financial crisis C to underestimate rather than
overestimate the pace and impact of China’s growth.30 For example, an influential article by Gerald
Segal published in 1999 in Foreign Affairs, which sought to offer a corrective to the 1990s narrative of
China’s rise by highlighting the challenges facing it, has since been shown to have been too
pessimistic.31 If China’s rise is conditional, therefore, it may simply be a case of ‘not yet’,32 and that ‘not
yet’ may be short-lived.

The pace of this rise over recent years requires reconsideration of another long-standing question in
analysis of China’s international relations, namely whether it is a ‘status quo’ power, content with the
international order and its rules, or a ‘revisionist’ power, anxious to change them. There is a broad
consensus in the literature that by the 1990s there had been a clear shift in Chinese policy from the
radical revisionism of much of the Mao era to acceptance of and engagement with the existing
international order, symbolized by growing participation in UN peacekeeping operations, the
application to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) and engagement with regional multilateral
institutions such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).33 Precise judgments over the
extent to which China had become a status quo power vary, but by the early 2000s China was
increasingly seen as one.34 Over recent years, however, China’s engagement with the existing system
and institutions has increasingly been seen as falling short of a full embrace, with elements of gentle
revisionism highlighted more. China has become more of what one Chinese scholar called a ‘reformminded
status quo power’.35 As Peter Ferdinand and Jue Wang show, for example, China has ‘gradually
accommodated itself to the norms of international financial governance […] and has integrated itself
into the IMF’, but has more recently become ‘a little more confident in expressing alternative positions
openly’.36
Others are more critical. Barry Naughton says that China ‘seems perpetually dissatisfied with the global
[economic] system, and determined to extract as many benefits as it can from the system without,
however, making any constructive proposals to change the system’.37 There are also those who argue
that efforts in China to identify ‘Chinese’ sources of International Relations theory, including by looking
back into history at models such as the imperial tributary systems, suggest a more radical revisionism
on the part of Chinese scholars.38 However, it should also be noted that one feature of the way such
models are presented is to highlight the potential for a strong China to live peacefully with its
neighbours.39 These efforts to identify ‘Chinese’ approaches to international relations speak to a wider
sense of the country going its own way, ‘an emerging sense of “Chinese exceptionalism” C an idea that
China is fundamentally different from other countries, with some sort of global duty and responsibility
to promote an alternative to the dominant global order’.40 It should also be noted that Chinese policymakers
have been aware of perceptions that China is revisionist, and attempted to ‘construct an image
of it as a “responsible great power”’ to address this.41

These points relate to a further question, particularly germane to devising policy responses, as to how
China’s rise should be characterized C ‘peaceful’, ‘assertive’, ‘aggressive’ C and how these
characterizations might be changing. There is no simple consensus in the existing analysis, though
there is a general sense that at some point after 2008 Chinese foreign policy became more assertive, or
firmer (see below).42 At the same time, while the Chinese leadership’s use of the term ‘peaceful rise’ has
long bitten the dust,43 Chinese diplomats continue to reiterate that China is ‘committed to the path of
peaceful development’.44 Underlying this is a particular sense of China’s own identity as a naturally
‘peaceful power’;45 while remaining sceptical about the tendency this implies of reducing identity to a
single ‘essence’, and mindful of the fact that China has engaged in brief military conflicts in earlier
decades, this self-understanding should still be seen as a partial constraint on foreign and security
policy.
In contrast, structural realists such as John Mearsheimer see an unfolding ‘tragedy’ of inevitable
conflict between a rising and established power.46 Others emphasize the response of those dominant in
the existing order as a major variable in determining whether the emergence of a rising power will lead
to conflict, bringing to the fore the importance of understanding how the United States and others
respond to China’s rise. Yet others see the development of institutions as something that will manage
this process of change.47
The conclusion here is that the world is not yet witnessing the beginnings of a global C or regional C
transition from US material dominance to China, even if there is evident nervousness among some in
the United States that a transition might come sooner than people think. This is even more so if we look
for a transition in hegemony understood as encompassing norms and legitimacy, neither of which
China is close to achieving. Nor is it clear that a transition in material power is inevitable; the United
States has historically shown a capacity for renewal and reinvention, and in their recent discussion of
US-Chinese scenarios, David Rapkin and William Thompson identify the possibility of a reversal of US
relative decline.48 Even if China were to overcome the limitations spelt out above and begin to match
the United States, it should be noted that many power transitions do not end in conflict, but in
renegotiation of order.49 This is perhaps what is currently being witnessed, and the longer-term implications of China’s rise therefore depend not just on the interactions between strategic and tactical
decisions made by the Chinese and other governments, but also on the political and economic impact of
Chinese non-state actors as they spread their activities and influence across much of the globe.50
All of these questions have implications for understanding China’s ‘identity’ in the global context, as
well as for its policy choices and those of other countries dealing with China. They form the basis for the
analysis in the rest of this paper, beginning with findings about China’s identity in international affairs.

Foreign policy under new leadership
Since the new leadership took over at the top of the Chinese Communist Party in November 2012,
followed by state appointments in March 2013 C including Xi Jinping as president and Li Keqiang as
premier C foreign-policy officials and party-guided media have made a number of statements about the
authorities’ approaches to international affairs.51 A short article published on 1 January 2014 by
Foreign Minister Wang Yi gives a recent official summary of the main concerns, and a presentation (for
domestic consumption) of Chinese approaches to diplomacy.52 Its main points are listed below.
-- The context is one of global flux: global economic transformation, change in the international
system, adjustment in the world situation including a move towards multipolarity, and deep
evolution in China’s relations with the rest of the world.
-- New concepts in Chinese diplomacy: the Chinese dream, peaceful development, building a new type
of major-power relationship with the United States (see below), clarifying the direction of
neighbourhood diplomacy, and promoting yiliguan (which could be translated as ‘viewpoint of
values and interests’).53
-- Innovations in Chinese diplomatic activity: making progress amid stable relations with big powers
(Russia, the United States, Europe), forging ahead in neighbourhood diplomacy, promoting
comprehensive diplomacy (from Africa to the Caribbean, etc.), engaging in multilateral diplomacy
with the BRICS, the G20, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and taking a proactive
approach to diplomatic hot spots such as North Korea, Syria, Iran and the Palestine.

-- A new style of Chinese diplomacy, which includes persisting in maintaining the UN Charter and
‘basic rules’ of the international system as the Chinese authorities see them, seeking justice for
developing countries, putting forward views on major international issues, promoting Chinese
initiatives and concepts, fulfilling China’s role, and developing the image of a responsible major
power. This should be underpinned by internal discipline and ‘strengthening the centralized and
unified leadership of the Party in diplomatic work’.
This last point on style and approach, taken with brief glimpses of a more proactive approach to the
Middle East54 and Chinese approaches in East Asia, begins to give official support for a more proactive
diplomacy in the future. In a 24 January interview with the Financial Times (and hence aimed at an
international audience),55 Foreign Minister Wang emphasized the role of development in Chinese
foreign policy, reiterated the hope that the United States and China could work together in the Asia-
Pacific,56 and talked about challenges in relations with Japan in particular.
The new leadership has also introduced institutional changes in the management of national security.
The Third Plenum of the Party’s Central Committee, which met in November 2013, agreed to establish a
National Security Commission (guojia anquan weiyuanhui), a body duly formed in late January 2014.
It is chaired by Xi Jinping, with the numbers two and three in the party hierarchy, Li Keqiang and
Zhang Dejiang, as vice chairs.57 Xi Jinping’s comments at the Third Plenum suggested the commission
looked likely to cover internal and external security issues, to be comprehensive in scope and to play a
key role in coordinating policy at the top.58 Reports of the first meeting, on 15 April, talked about a
‘comprehensive national security outlook’ and suggested that the body’s remit would cover 11 areas in
the realm of national security: politics, territory (homeland security), military, economy, culture,
society, science and technology, information, ecology, natural resources and nuclear security.59
Although the establishment of this body seems to be partly in response to official concerns about
inadequate coordination, against the background of commentary suggesting that the foreign policy
process has become subject to a wider range of actors and voices,60 some have underplayed the
existence of multiple voices, and commented that foreign policy-making has remained very
centralized.61 Whatever the assessment for the 2000s, following the 2012 leadership transition, it seems
increasingly clear that Xi Jinping is coordinating policy across many areas, including foreign and security policy, by chairing the National Security Commission and high-level leadership groups on
military reform and cyber security. His foreign visits and meetings with visiting dignitaries mean that
Xi is also being seen as China’s ‘chief diplomat’.62 All this gives him a higher level of personal
accountability for the success or otherwise of Chinese foreign and security policy than was the case
under the leadership of Hu Jintao, who played a lower-profile role in foreign affairs.
New type of major-power relations
Another self-proclaimed ‘innovation’ in Chinese diplomacy under the new leadership has been the idea
of developing a ‘new type of major power relations’.63 This was first mentioned by Xi Jinping when he
visited the United States as vice president in February 2012.64 Since then various Chinese statements
have fleshed out what is meant by the concept. The key concept here appears to be avoidance of conflict
(or ‘full-scale confrontation’, as one Chinese scholar put it) between the United States as the existing
hegemon and China as a rising power,65 or in other words, ‘no conflict, no confrontation, but mutual
respect and win-win cooperation’.66 Putting forward this concept is often cited as one of the main
achievements of Chinese diplomacy over the last year, and it can be argued that it has C unusually C
enabled Beijing to take more of a discursive lead in the USCChinese relationship.67 For the United
States, though, ‘rebalancing’ to Asia remains the dominant policy concept.68 This has been interpreted
with some suspicion in China as something between an ‘attempt to shape its peripheral environment’69
and a new effort to ‘contain’ its rise. Whereas many in the United States see Chinese revisionism in
Asia, many Chinese see US revisionism there.
Given this, the details of how a new type of relationship might be achieved are unclear, which has been
one of the reasons for caution in US responses. However, in a speech in November 2013, National
Security Advisor Susan Rice said that the United States sought ‘to operationalize a new model of major
power relations. That means managing inevitable competition while forging deeper cooperation on issues where our interests converge C in Asia and beyond’.70 She cited the Korean peninsula (in some
detail), the Iran nuclear issue, Afghanistan, Sudan and ‘bolster[ing] peace and development in places
like sub-Saharan Africa’ as examples of these. Other comments by US officials have highlighted
cooperation on the environment and climate change, and this has been one of the issues on which the
two governments have announced substantive new cooperation following recent high-level visits and
meetings.
The key question for the future is how feasible it might be for the United States and China to work
cooperatively on regional or global issues, and whether the relationship is characterized by hierarchy or
equality. There has been much debate about the need for ‘trust’, with two prominent scholars from the
United States and China C Kenneth Lieberthal and Wang Jisi C suggesting in joint work that there is a
lack of ‘strategic trust’, namely the ‘failure to develop trust in the long-term intentions of each [the
United States and China] toward the other’.71 This implies that, in spite of the popular persistence of the
idea that the two countries might develop some sort of ‘G2’ structure for oversight of global affairs,72
there is little prospect of this happening in the near future. The main strategic aim for the relationship
is to avoid a negative spiral.
China’s identity: developed or developing?
As one Chinese academic argues, China is facing an ‘identity crisis’ in its foreign policy, in the form of a
series of debates on which there is as yet no consensus. Is China a developed or developing country? Is
it status quo or revisionist? Should it continue with a low-profile strategy (taoguang yanghui,
attributed to Deng Xiaoping) or be more assertive? 73 These questions highlight the areas of potential
flux in Chinese foreign policy at the moment.
The first part of this dilemma has been created in part by the nature of China’s economic rise.74 A huge
increase in aggregate economic size has made its economy the second largest in the world, but although
GDP per capita has also increased dramatically it remains around 100th in global league tables. This
dilemma has been mentioned by one observer as a problem for Chinese diplomacy: judging solely by its
economic size, China is a major country (daguo), but what standard of measurement should be used for
this is open to debate.75 And therefore the main challenges resulting from this are domestic and
developmental, namely to raise the levels of GDP per capita, which reinforces the official position that
national development remains the primary driver for Chinese diplomacy. While the official position of the government is that China remains a developing country, the same observer notes that, whether it
was the United Kingdom or other European countries seeking investment from China, or African
countries looking at China’s growing influence, these countries did not (in these contexts at least) any
longer see China as a developing country.76
It has similarly been noted that many African countries in particular believe that China did not behave
like a developing country, and that this was also the impression given when European officials travelled
to Beijing seeking financial support.77 In some cases, China’s insistence on presenting itself as a
developing country actually created new concerns elsewhere about the authorities’ intentions, raising
questions as to why they were so insistent on using this term given the extent of their country’s global
economic power. This sense that the Chinese authorities might be being deliberately deceptive is one
which comes up frequently in discussions with policy-makers outside China.
Wang Jisi has broadened this dilemma away from economic aspects, commenting that
The depiction of China as the world’s No 2 belies many facts. First, the European Union as a whole remains
the world’s largest economy, although it is undergoing a serious setback. The Europeans play a greater role
than the Chinese in most international economic and political arenas. Second, by a few important measures,
Russia is still militarily stronger than China. Finally, and more importantly, China still lags far behind the
Western powers and Japan in terms of per capita income and technological innovation.78
A sense of being squeezed or caught between developed and developing countries comes out in part of a
November 2013 article by Vice Premier Wang Yang on China’s economic openness. Discussing global
economic governance, Wang said that
Some developed countries have ever-increasing demands on [China] on issues such as rebalancing the
global economy, dealing with climate change, the RMB exchange rate, protecting intellectual property
rights, market openness, etc; while some developing countries also have more and more expectations of
[China].79
However, Wang goes on to say that there has been no change in the position of China as being ‘in the
primary stage of socialism’ and being ‘the [world’s] largest developing country’.80 In other contexts
Chinese policy-makers deploy the third category of ‘emerging economies’ into which China and a
number of other countries fall. But in spite of discussion about the challenges in dealing with China’s
identity as either developed or developing, the official line on its status as a developing country remains
unchanged.81 However, this underlines the ongoing challenge facing China, given the difficulty of
influencing the perceptions of others or the wider discourse about it.

	<b><a name="T8">How assertive?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The idea that Chinese regional policy has become more assertive in the years after 2008 has become
generally accepted, even though there are differences of opinion over when this shift began and whether
to characterize it as firm, assertive or aggressive. Discussion of the reasons for this shift fall into four
broad camps, though these should not be seen as exclusive, and the policy shift is likely to be the result
of more than one factor.82
First, it is said to reflect domestic politics in China, in particular the 2012 leadership transition at the
top of the Communist Party and the subsequent need of the new leaders to demonstrate their
nationalist credentials and/or firmness with the military. Variations of this argument claim that
factional infighting at the top of the party is pushing Xi Jinping to take a more assertive stance.
Interestingly this sort of argument seems to be quite common among Japanese analysts, perhaps
because it diverts attention from other explanations outlined below that have less comfortable
implications for Japan. Without going into the issue of elite politics in China, it should be noted that
planning for the leadership transition to Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang began as far back as 2007, that Xi
Jinping took the top military post (chair of the Communist Party’s Central Military Commission) in
November 2012 at the same time as the top party job, and that these indicated a smooth transition to
new leadership. This argument is therefore unlikely to have significant explanatory power.
The second explanation given is that China’s greater assertiveness is a defensive response to some
combination of the US ‘pivot’ or ‘rebalance’ to Asia (which has produced a sense in Chinese policymaking
circles that the United States is increasing efforts to ‘contain’ China) and/or changes in
Japanese policy (first the ‘nationalization’ of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, which C in Chinese eyes C
reneged on the previous understanding between China and Japan, and subsequently a more forward
security policy under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe). Those who are critical of the US approach to East
Asia and of Japanese policy C or see a major strategic challenge coming from potential instability in the
USCJapanese relationship C tend to be more attracted by this explanation. It also fits with an
assessment of Chinese realism as being more defensive than offensive in nature, i.e. aiming to maximize
security rather than power.
A third explanation is that China’s behaviour represents tactical opportunism. The space for this was
created by the 2008 global financial crisis, which spurred support for alternatives to the Washington
Consensus, reinforced the idea of China as a responsible regional actor (and global actor since many
developed economy governments beseeched it to boost global economic growth), and increased China’s
importance in Asia especially as a market and provider of finance.83 At the same time, while China’s
formal positions on issues of sovereignty in relation to Japan or in the South China Sea have remained unchanged,84 opportunities to assert these have arisen over the last few years, and the Chinese
authorities have taken those opportunities. There are arguably historical precedents for this
opportunism (China took the Paracels from South Vietnam’s control in 1974, and Mischief Reef from
the Philippines in 1995).
Fourth, while it is difficult to judge intentions beyond the public statements of Chinese officials, a
further explanation is that there is a conscious strategy to change aspects of the regional order in East
Asia and enhance China’s power or influence relative to other regional powers and the United States.
This is therefore more of a strategic than tactical development and reinforces the notion of flux in and
renegotiation of the regional order.85 This explanation would certainly fit the desire of elements in
China advocating greater assertion of its global strength. On the other hand, it is less consistent with
official statements, including following a high-profile October 2013 internal meeting chaired by Xi
Jinping on ‘neighbourhood diplomacy’, which emphasized the importance of good relations with
China’s neighbours.
Finally, a self-described ‘innovation’ in China’s diplomacy that might support this last interpretation is
the idea of ‘bottom line (dixian) diplomacy’. Although the idea has not featured much in public
statements by Chinese diplomats, it is often mentioned as an important innovation under the new
leadership. The idea is to test the ‘bottom line’ of other countries in dealing with China, including
(although this was not made explicit) the United States and its ‘commitment’ in East Asia. This fits with
another theme that was a public part of statements of Chinese diplomacy in reports of a January 2013
Politburo meeting on foreign policy under the new leadership, namely the upholding of ‘core interests’
(a phrase that appeared to expand in scope in 2010 to include sovereignty claims in the South China
Sea).86 This ‘bottom line’ concept could also explain the announcement in November 2013 of China’s
Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the East China Sea, a step that otherwise looks
incompatible with the emphasis on neighbourhood diplomacy (or needs to be explained by assuming
institutional competition or dysfunction in the Chinese system, which are not persuasive).

Research for this paper confirmed the mainstream analysis identified in the literature, suggesting that
there is an underlying dissatisfaction with certain aspects of the international system among Chinese
policy elites, but that efforts to change this will be moderate and cooperative in nature, and that there is
a preference for institutions composed of states. One observer emphasized that ‘international
consensus’ is needed for any changes to international rules and it can therefore be expected that the Chinese government will look for opportunities to engage in negotiation about these rules, but from
within the system. Another argued that China will definitely look to influence and change the rules
regarding global economic governance, many elements of which are not beneficial; as the second largest
economy, China should have an impact here but many of its demands are also shared by other
countries, especially the BRICS.87 China’s approach to international institutions has also been
characterized as first accepting, then learning and then modifying (but not radically changing) them.88
These conclusions align with analysis that ‘the (official) aim is to reform the system not overthrow it,
and to reform it responsibly from within’.89
A related question is about Chinese views of the role of the United States in East Asia and the western
Pacific. According to one analyst, the Chinese government ‘absolutely does not’ want to get rid of the
United States in East Asia.90 This is a view confirmed in discussions with different actors, including
with Chinese diplomats, and has recently been restated by Foreign Minister Wang Yi.91 However, as
discussion of Chinese approaches to relations with the United States shows, there is an ongoing debate
C which perhaps is best characterized as a negotiation C as to what role China would ideally like to see
the United States play in the region. The implication of a ‘new type of major power relations’ is that this
should be different from what occurred in the past, and that the United States should not enjoy
unchallenged primacy in Asia.92
This line of thinking reinforces analyses that suggest there is an ongoing renegotiation of the order in
East Asia. Further, Chinese experts frequently express the view that Japan is trying to change the
regional order, following its ‘nationalization’ of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in 2012. On the other hand,
Japanese analysts point the finger at China for having become more ‘assertive’ or ‘aggressive’ or seeking
to change the regional order.
The idea of flux in the regional order also resonates with some Chinese academics. Chen Dongxiao
describes the current period as the 'third round of rebuilding' of the Asia-Pacific order (the first two
being in the Cold War and during the 1990s). His is a dynamic analysis that reflects the rise of Asia, not
just China, and assumes that the United States ‘is incapable of dominating the regional order as it used
to’. Chen highlights a disconnect between economic cooperation and growth in security concerns and ‘maritime’ disputes. He hints at concern that a scenario where the security tensions undermine
economic exchange might come to pass.93
The precise Chinese objectives in a renegotiation of regional order are less clear. As noted above, they
do not seem to include a region without the United States, though a change in the US role and influence
is an aim. Occasional non-official Chinese comments to the effect that US alliances in East Asia might
not contribute to regional stability (as opposed to the security of the US allies) may suggest some
thinking that a recalibration of these alliances would be welcomed by China. More widely, while some
have suggested that there is not a clear Chinese conception of alternatives to the existing international
order, Shaun Breslin identifies several anti-unipolar elements to an alternative Chinese vision:
a commitment to multilateralism underpinned by the central role of the UN as the guarantor of global
security; a commitment to consultation and dialogue rather than force as a means of settling disputes; a
commitment to global economic development, with the developed world taking a greater share of the
responsibility for promoting growth elsewhere; and a ‘spirit of inclusiveness’, recognizing all societies and
cultures as coexistent and equal stakeholders in the global order.94
This brings out some contradictions in Chinese thinking C even without looking at the complex
relationships between official and non-official actors. On the one hand, officials talk about change and
flux in the international order, and seem to be pushing ‘bottom lines’ of other regional players (see
above). On the other hand, official statements make much of continuity in policy, including the
references to ‘peaceful development’ driving the country’s diplomacy (and indeed an assessment that
peace and development are still the main trends of the times in the post-Cold War world).95 Chinese
policy-makers appear to see an opportunity in the flux of the international order, but what they say they
want is something of a return to an imagined status quo ante: the UN charter and a system of nonintervention
that predated post-Cold War policy shifts among other major powers that include the
‘responsibility to protect’, accommodating non-traditional security concerns and the impact of
intensified post-Cold War globalization on international relations.

This analysis implies that Chinese assertiveness in the region is carefully calibrated, and should be
characterized as bargaining, rather than something more dramatic such as a prelude to the use of
military force.96 If this is the case, then key to understanding the implications of this shift is looking at
the way it has been intertwined with the evolving policy positions of other regional players, including
the United States and its ongoing ‘rebalance’ to Asia. It is clear that these responses have varied over time, between Northeast and Southeast Asia, and among countries. From 2010, many Southeast Asian
countries sought to balance China’s growing influence by encouraging greater US engagement and
seeking assurances of US intentions to act to maintain regional security. Of these, the Philippines
moved particularly close to the United States, while Vietnam’s response has been more nuanced. At the
same time as seeking closer defence ties with the United States, Vietnam has also strengthened military
dialogue with China. Evelyn Goh suggests that the United States’ stronger focus on the South China Sea
issue from 2010 appeared ‘to intensify the security dilemma’, and this may have contributed to
subsequent efforts by Southeast Asian states to (re)balance both the United States and China C what
Goh calls ‘most ASEAN states’ imperative of autonomy: to restrain China without making it impossible
to live with, to borrow US deterrence without becoming entirely dependent upon it, and to safeguard
ASEAN’s relevance and role in regional conflict management’.97
In Northeast Asia, the dynamic has been different, with debate dominated by the deterioration in Sino-
Japanese relations, particularly since autumn 2012. At the same time, South Korea has sought to
balance its relationships between China, Japan and the United States, with a particular dynamic
resulting from historical issues between Japan and Korea, and an apparent cooling in relations under
new leadership in both Japan and South Korea. Throughout this period US officials have stressed that
the United States is not about ‘to abandon allies’ in East Asia, and if Washington is open to
renegotiating the regional order (or even attempting to do so itself, in contrast to its statements on
maintaining the status quo), then the ‘rebalance’ policy, strengthening existing military alliances, and
pushing forward the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) seem to be the ways in which Washington has
decided to promote change in East Asia.
The debate and contestation around China’s identity also bring implications for policy. ‘Layers of
national identities’98 provide a range of resources for policy-makers to call on in relation to different
issues, or at different points in time. Analysis by Wei Zonglei and Fu Yu neatly summarizes some of the
themes by suggesting that China has four simultaneous identities: as a developing country, as an
emerging power, through its position as a permanent member of the UN Security Council as a state that
has ‘both global power and global responsibility’, and as a ‘quasi-superpower’, of which expectations are
higher than for other countries.99 David Shambaugh concludes that ‘China possesses multiple
international identities and is a conflicted country in its international persona’.100 China’s global
personality is therefore complex and dynamic, and in a process of flux, driven by debates within the
country, and magnified by a global context characterized by a period of shifts in traditional economic
balance and political power.

	<b><a name="T11">Shaping Chinese positions by issue</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
On the basis of this analysis about different layers of identity, and some of the ambiguities and
contradictions in Chinese approaches to the regional and international order, one should expect to see
different behaviour by China in different contexts, rather than a coherent, logically consistent approach
across issues (as is the case with most other countries). Therefore a number of key points or indicators
in the shaping of China’s positions on the specific issues selected for this research are identified here.
International peace and security
Geographically, China’s primary focus will remain on relations with the United States and in Asia.101 At
the same time, its foreign policy is self-consciously ‘global’ or ‘omni-directional’ (quanfangwei),
envisaging engagement across all continents. This will be increasingly important given the growing
global spread of Chinese economic and commercial interests in particular, and proactive engagement
across all continents is to be expected.
More widely, China will continue to push for gradual shifts in the regional and international order that
are favourable to its interests but without engaging in radical revisionism. It will call for long-term
reform instead of immediate revision.
Notwithstanding its opposition to expansion of the Security Council, China will continue to emphasize
the United Nations as the primary international institution for addressing global issues, pointing back
to the UN framework. This will be supported by continued involvement in UN peacekeeping operations:
if anything, this engagement will grow as it provides a politically neutral way of enhancing China’s
global experience, as well as of addressing concerns that increasingly have an impact on its interests as
these become more global. China will continue to face dilemmas over UN voting on intervention in
problem areas around the world, such as with Syria and Ukraine.102
There will also be a gradually more proactive approach to a number of important international security
issues outside the immediate Asian region. China’s brief high-profile diplomacy on the Middle East
peace process in mid-2013 was an example of this. Wang Yi has also highlighted Chinese involvement
in Syria and the issue of Iran’s nuclear programme, among others (though this is often not how it looks
from the outside).
Relations with other global and regional powers, especially BRICS and the United
States
As set out above, China has outlined what it calls a new approach to the USCChinese relationship: the
‘new type of major power relations’. This remains the relationship with the greatest potential to have a major impact across China’s foreign and security policy, in particular the all-important relationships
with its Asian neighbours.
China has sought to balance this by emphasizing relations with other major powers, in particular Russia.
It has also left some ambiguity as to whether it might apply the ‘new type’ of relations to powers other
than the United States. Up to the start of the crisis in Ukraine at least, Xi Jinping had made personal
diplomacy with President Vladimir Putin a priority, calling him an ‘old friend’ in media interviews,
meeting him four times in 2013, and attending the opening of the Sochi Winter Olympics. There are
commonalities in Chinese and Russian approaches to a number of international issues (though not
identical positions, including on Syria). However, underlying contradictions in the relationship remain,
including Russia’s concern about Chinese influence in its Far East, and the implications of China
developing greater indigenous capacity to produce defence systems for which it had previously had to
depend on Russia. Russia’s annexation of Crimea has also posed a dilemma for Chinese foreign policy,
which continues to emphasize non-interference in a country’s internal affairs and is sensitive about
applying notions of self-determination.
Europe and the EU did not feature so prominently in Chinese diplomacy during the first year of new
leadership, although it was consistently referred to alongside Russia and the United States as a ‘major
power’ in official statements. However, Xi Jinping’s visit to Europe in April saw the first visit by a
Chinese president to the European Commission, and highlighted an ongoing strategy of engagement at
the level of the EU and its member states.
China has also given priority to relations with India, with reciprocal head-of-government visits in 2013
(the first time these have taken place in the same year since the 1950s). It has also developed economic
relations with Pakistan. As for Afghanistan, there are signs of Chinese nervousness about the country’s
future. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) will continue to play an important role in China’s
regional diplomacy.
Chinese policy-makers see a ‘rightist tendency’ becoming more prominent in Japan, though some note
that this is not new, pointing to the premiership of Junichiro Koizumi. Strategically, owing to its
proximity and to economic ties, Japan remains important for China, and policy-makers continue to
insist they want good relations, even as they highlight lingering historical problems.103 On the
Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, China wants Japan to acknowledge there is a dispute C though given
developments since the pre-2012 ‘shelving’ of the issue it is difficult to go back to that position. This
perhaps suggests that the Chinese government does not have a very clear objective in its Japan policy.
On North Korea, in spite of evident Chinese dissatisfaction with the behaviour of the regime in
Pyongyang, there is little prospect of significant change in its strategy of supporting the country’s policy
independence, opposing nuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and encouraging direct contacts
between it and the United States. 

Policy engagement with other regions will also grow. For example, Latin America and the Caribbean are
growing in importance to China as trading partners, sources of resources and investment
destinations.104 This is an example of a region for which China’s continued self-identification as a
‘developing country’ raises some of the questions identified above.

China’s approach to multilateralism underwent a profound change in the 1990s, with a shift to
engagement in regional and international institutions. The extent and nature of this engagement have
been differentiated across institutions and issues C from ongoing reluctance to engage in multilateral
discussion of the South China Sea to a quasi-leadership role in the Central Asia-focused SCO. In terms
of global economic governance, engagement has been clearer and has grown.
There are small signs of change towards multilateral regional security institutions, contrasted with
intensified engagement in regional economic institutions (as witnessed by announcements in late 2013
that China would seek to ‘upgrade’ the ChineseCASEAN free trade agreement, develop a ‘maritime Silk
Road’ with Southeast Asia, and construct a ‘new Silk Road’ with Central Asia).
There is likely to be more proactive engagement with international institutions dealing with trade,
investment and economic issues, including the G20, which China would like to see remain at the centre
of international consultations over the global economy. The September 2013 bid to join the WTO tradein-
services negotiations also marked an effort at more proactive engagement (though it is not clear
whether others will accept China’s participation). There is a sense in China that the United States
operates in bad faith in these areas, as witnessed by a US desire to shift back from the G20 as the focal
gathering and the fact that quota reform at the International Monetary Fund is being held up by the US
Congress. China has so far kept mostly quiet on these points, but it could raise them more vocally in
future.
China remains suspicious that US prioritization of the TPP and Transatlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership agreements is at least partly targeted at making it more difficult for China to dominate
Asian and transatlantic trade and investment. As one observer puts it, these trade negotiations ‘seem to
confront China’.105 The Chinese response has shifted from hostility to engagement, however, using the
challenge to feed momentum for domestic reform (as well as focusing on the East Asian Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership). China’s first aim will be the Bilateral Investment Treaty with
the United States, which the two governments agreed in 2013 they would begin to negotiate. China will
seek to join TPP in due course if the institution takes off.
There will be further talking up of institutions where China plays a key role. This includes the APEC
summit to be held in Beijing this year. However, over the medium term Asian regional institutions that
are limited in scope to countries in East Asia, rather than straddling the Asia-Pacific region, will remain
more attractive to Chinese policy-makers. Although China is likely to remain engaged with the East Asia Summit, the ASEAN Regional Forum and the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting Plus, these will not be
the main priorities.
There will also be more careful and proactive engagement with the BRICS (as an institution and in
bilateral relations with its other members) as well as with other emerging powers such as Indonesia,
Mexico and Turkey.106 The aim will be to pursue common agendas where possible (for example on
reforming aspects of the international system), but China is probably also aware of the need to avoid
giving the impression of being overbearing.107
Cyber issues
Cyber issues are looked at here from a political and policy perspective rather than a technical one,
viewing cyberspace in a broader context. The potential for these issues to have a serious impact in
Chinese diplomacy was seen in the summer of 2013 when US criticism of China for commercial and
state ‘cyber-espionage’ reached fever pitch in the run-up to the informal summit between Xi Jinping
and Barack Obama in California, before the Snowden revelations (which coincided with the summit)
changed the global debate dramatically. There is little coverage of these issues C which have risen to
prominence relatively recently C in most of the secondary literature reviewed for this paper, though one
recent book by a US scholar covers briefly what it calls ‘China’s undeclared cyberwar against the United
States and other countries’. It focuses on alleged Chinese economic espionage and claims that evidence
of the complicity of Chinese government agencies is ‘overwhelming’.108 In turn, the Chinese authorities
have said they too are the ‘victim’ of attacks, and have sometimes pointed the finger at the United
States, though often in less explicit terms. Both have refuted the other’s accusations.109
From a broader perspective, international rule-making (i.e. between states) in the cyber world is an
interesting test case for Chinese policy. This is a new venture at a time when China is seen as an
important and influential player, in contrast to Chinese complaints that international rules in other
areas were set at a time when it was not so influential. It is therefore worth watching closely to see how
China approaches this, which other governments it works with, and how proactive its cyber diplomacy
is.
Michael Swaine has looked recently at Chinese official and semi-official comments on cyber security in
foreign relations.110 He shows that Chinese policy elites present this as an international issue and a
common problem facing many countries. At the same time, they talk about ‘sovereign virtual territory’

on the internet, as an area that needs to be policed by governments. This more ‘state-centric
orientation’ is different from that of Western governments, such as those of the United States and
Canada. In terms of addressing the cyber security challenge, Swaine shows that Chinese statements
emphasize the need for ‘constructive dialogue’ to reach a common solution, and that the UN is ‘the most
appropriate forum’ for setting rules.111 What China wants to avoid is rules set by the US-led multistakeholder
model C and underlying at least some Chinese analysis is the concern that the internet is a
tool of US hegemony.
There is a different tone to relevant material from two Chinese policy institutes, both of which reiterate
the point about China being a cyber victim. Comments in one paper highlighted ‘infighting’ and
‘competition’ between Western countries and emerging powers (China and Russia); while the former
held that existing law was applicable and there was no need to develop new standards only to devise
confidence-building measures to exchange information, the latter C according to this account C upheld
the principle of sovereignty in relation to cyberspace.112 Language in a report published by another
institute is more conciliatory: it calls for coordination and consensus in international cyber governance,
in the interests of global development.113 A recent joint USCChinese policy report on developing a new
type of major power relations also calls for greater cooperation in cyber security.114 This looks
increasingly unlikely following the recent US charges for cyber crimes against Chinese individuals, in
response to which China has cancelled the bilateral dialogue.

Scenarios
This section first notes some scenarios set out in the existing literature, then comments on them briefly
on the basis of the analysis above. It rejects determinist ways of thinking C whether of the type that
suggests an inevitable ‘tragedy’ as a rising power confronts an established hegemon, or for that matter
the assertions in the official Chinese position that the world is moving inexorably towards multipolarity.
This is not to deny structural constraints placed on future scenarios, which have to be constructed on
the basis of the legacies of the present and the past. But it does suggest that numerous future scenarios
are possible, and that the decisions of the various global actors will be important in shaping the futures
that emerge. In a sense this is the most important conclusion of this paper: that the implications of
China’s rise can be affected by the choices made not just in China and the United States, but elsewhere
C though obviously subject to the constraints of relative power and influence in the international
system.

Broadly put, there have been two long-standing post-Cold War scenarios around China’s rise, what
Barry Buzan has called ‘malign and benign’.115 The first sees China’s rise accompanied by strengthening
revisionist tendencies and an authoritarian and militaristic posture that follows from its nondemocratic
political system.116 The second is based on growing ‘socialization’, acceptance of the status
quo and cooperation rather than confrontation. And within Asia, there are two broad ways of thinking
about how to react to China’s rise: either bandwagoning by other states, leading to China becoming like
a hub (this could be seen as a reversion to the sort of tribute model which fell apart in the late Qing
dynasty), or balancing as China’s neighbours seek to balance its rise by sticking closer to the United
States, leading to a deepening of divisions between Asian powers.
Consistent with these themes, Chen Dongxiao offers three scenarios for Asia.117 The first is an extension
of the status quo, featuring cooperation and interdependence in economic fields, but not in political and
security matters. The second envisages cooperation in political and security arenas as well as in
economic interactions, while the third sees intensification of competition spreading to the economic
sphere, even ‘economic warfare’. David Rapkin and William Thompson’s five scenarios for a possible
USCChinese transition explore the options in more detail. These range from ‘more of the same’ to ‘Pax
Americana II’ (a US revival reverses its relative decline), ‘Pax Sinica’ (Chinese dominance), a ‘transition
war’ (between China and the United States) and a ‘liberal peace’ (based on a liberal order). In this
context, the value of Evelyn Goh’s approach is to emphasize ongoing processes of renegotiation, moving
beyond the various either/or features of most scenario analysis and integrating the intertwining of
foreign and security policy formation between the various actors.
Policy-makers also need to consider some low-probability but high-impact developments. Rather than
looking at triggers for such scenarios (for example, the accidental shooting down of an aircraft),
consideration of such developments requires reversing some of the main assumptions about the drivers
of China’s global personality, without looking at possible major changes in the global context.118
The first of these potential developments is a shift to a strongly revisionist approach, which might
stimulate China’s withdrawal from regional or global institutions. This could result from growing
nationalist influence on policy-making or from external changes that either give China the opportunity
to capitalize on a revisionist approach, or provoke it into strong revisionism. Domestic change could
come from turmoil such as weakening of the Communist Party in elite politics, from military dominance in foreign and security policy, or arguably even from a democratic transformation (unlikely
though this seems at the moment).119
Second, the emergence of transformative technologies in China that give it a breakthrough opportunity
to overtake the United States as the leading global economy could presage a shift to a foreign and
security policy that seeks to capitalize more on the country’s economic strength. This could involve
either compromises in the interests of better economic relationships with other countries, or
assertiveness where markets are not opened up to China.
China turning in on itself, with a revival of Mao-era emphasis on ‘self-reliance’ in the face of a world
perceived to be increasingly hostile to its development, is another potential low-probability, highimpact
development. This would still require some external engagement by China to meet its resource
needs, but would reverse the global ‘omni-directional’ nature of current policy.
A final development might be the serious curtailment of China’s ability to project economic or military
power by a non-traditional security crisis (for example, in the areas of water resources, infectious
diseases, environmental degradation). China would then become much weaker relative to other
countries (assuming these do not suffer equally from such a crisis).

	<b><a name="T14">Policy implications</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	


The policy implications for other countries of China’s rise appear to have been well studied. However,
the majority of non-Chinese accounts have been written by individuals or institutions in the United
States for a US audience. As Shaun Breslin says in looking at China’s regional rise, a ‘key problem is the
near-impossibility of disentangling the study of China’s regional relations from conceptions of US
(in)security’, with one result being that many studies about China are also for people in the United
States.120 One implication of this is that external perceptions of China’s global personality have been
unduly dominated by voices emanating from the United States, and therefore C consciously or
subconsciously C have been influenced by questions of US policy-making and assessments of US
interests. There is much at stake in these accounts too C as Brantly Womack writes, for example, ‘China
has become for the United States the symbol of a future in which its control is diminished’.121 This
section of the paper therefore looks at the policy implications for developed countries other than the
United States and that are not neighbours of China.122
The above analysis has focused primarily on developments from Chinese perspectives to map out some
of the ways in which China’s ‘global personality’ might evolve. As should also be clear, however, the
questions are not just about choices made or actions taken by Chinese actors (official or unofficial,
inside or outside the country). The ‘behaviour’ of many other countries has implications for China’s global personality, intertwined with how that personality is perceived by those who deal with China.
The United States remains the single most important of these countries, and as noted above, discussion
of US policy choices dominates the non-Chinese literature about the ‘rise of China’. In Asia, Japanese
choices are particularly important, but so are those by the Koreas, Southeast Asian countries, India and
others.




Often non-Chinese policy debates are about ‘how to respond to the rise of China’.123 But this may not be
the right question to ask: as argued above, this places the agenda-setting primarily in China’s hands,
whereas it may be that other countries C or global and regional trends (‘globalization’, etc.) C are
driving global and national social, economic and political change, and hence constitute the framework
within which an assessment of the ‘flux’ in global affairs should be examined.124 Questions of
framework and agency are not just academic: if policy-makers assume that China is the only party
whose behaviour matters (this might translate into China as being the only object of ‘lobbying’ attempts
to influence developments in East Asia), then they will deny themselves a wider and potentially more
useful range of tools to affect the evolution of regional order.





The alternative conceptual framework is based on the idea explored by Evelyn Goh of the renegotiation
of regional order in East Asia in the context of a wider ‘fundamental structural realignment of world
politics.’125 In this case, the question becomes who should be involved, and how. All major global
economies have interests in the outcome, especially those with significant economic and trading
relationships (a substantial proportion of Europe’s imports come through the South China Sea, for
example, meaning that there is a direct interest in the maintenance of stability and in genuine freedom
of maritime access). This requires engagement with China, but also with other major regional actors C
starting with the United States and Japan C as well as with multilateral and regional institutions. In
sum, the response from countries outside Asia to the emergence of China should not just be a China
policy, but one of regional engagement.
So far, there seems to have been relatively little discussion along these lines. One exception perhaps is
Francois Godement’s analysis of the implications of developments in Asia for Europe.126 He argues that
the EU should give up the idea that the sort of multilateral security institutions that worked for Europe
should be promoted in Asia.127 Instead, he suggests that Europe should take a more proactive approach
to security issues in East Asia, utilizing the growth in Europe’s arms sales to the region; and that the EU
should learn from the United States’ regional approach to trade agreements, and develop something to
match the US promotion of the TPP.

One key implication of this regional policy approach is that it also involves taking a view on what
approach to Asia C and within this to China C others would like to see the United States take. There has
been recent public debate around this issue in Australia, following President Obama’s high-profile
speech in Canberra in 2011, and more recently after the government strongly condemned China’s
establishment of an ADIZ, leading to a critical response from Beijing and debate in Australia as to
whether this position had been in Australia’s interests.128 It has long been judged in much of the
literature that other Asian countries (particularly those in Southeast Asia) would be concerned if the
United States were to take a position too hostile to China C as suggested above, they do not want to
have to choose between the United States and China.
Similar dilemmas may increasingly be applied to countries outside Asia. In the United Kingdom, for
example, the government has found itself actively wooing investment from Chinese companies that
have been identified in the United States as posing potential threats to national security. This may
reflect a judgment that economic interests C to which should be added concerns about climate change,
the environment, innovation and development, addressing ‘non-traditional’ transnational concerns C
are strategically more important than traditional security concerns, especially in a region that does not
appear to offer any immediate security risk. The issue this raises is whether and to what extent strategic
interests of non-regional actors in East Asia are aligned with those of the United States. There has been
a general assumption, arguably since the Second World War, that in terms of security this alignment
has been foundational C though this is occasionally challenged in contexts that are not limited to
Asia.129 Is the ongoing negotiation of regional order in East Asia stimulated to a substantial degree by
the rise of China, a process that is drawing the interests of countries outside the region further away
from those of the United States? If so, what should the strategic response by such countries be?
The answer to the first question depends on the USCChinese dynamic, which depends in turn partly on
how the United States deals with flux in Asia. If, as advocated by Hugh White, it responds by choosing
not to try to hold onto regional ‘primacy’, or C to use the terminology of the ‘new type of major power
relations’ C it engages in more of a dialogue of equals with China (and indeed with other emerging and
existing powers, including perhaps Japan too), then the dilemma for countries outside the region is less
stark, and maybe even falls away. If, on the other hand, the United States decides that China represents
a ‘strategic threat’ and makes a ‘choice [...] for rivalry’,130 then the policy dilemmas for these countries
are likely to grow. It is therefore in their interests to encourage the first type of US response. If the
second scenario comes to pass, then there will need to be frank acknowledgment of different strategic
interests in East Asia from those of the United States. This will give rise to a challenging process in
deciding how to deal with them.
Engaging with Chinese policy-makers is also part of this response. Countries outside the region should
at the same time encourage China to behave in ways that reduce tensions in its relationship with the
United States and the risks involved in renegotiating regional order. Such lobbying seems to come more

naturally to Western governments at least, and the important point here is that engagement is required
with all parties concerned C not just China C to try to shape a regional future that minimizes the
security risks and maximizes the attainment of economic, environmental and other objectives.
The current difficult and tense USCChinese relationship at the strategic level looks likely to continue for
some time (though note that the same was said in early 2001, before 9/11 changed the United States’
calculus dramatically). If Western countries draw too close to the US position, this may create the risk
of a hardening of dividing lines in Asia. Amitai Etzioni comments that in the framework of a multipolar
world there is less reason to contain China as it becomes a regional power, whereas there is logic in
containing China if one sees the need for the United States as a hegemon.131 It is worth reiterating that
the US response is key: if Washington behaves in a way that responds to the multiple and complex
nature of China’s global personality, the prospects for hardening dividing lines recede somewhat, even
if underlying tensions remain.
The dynamics of China’s evolving global personality have the potential of creating ongoing difficulties
in the USCChinese relationship, and thus posing particular challenges for other developed countries
whose strategic interests have traditionally been close to those of the United States, but for which the
growing economic and commercial C and potentially even diplomatic C clout of China may offer more
opportunities than threats, particularly in a world dominated by non-traditional challenges around
resources, health or the environment. Dealing with these dilemmas requires innovative assessments of
national interest: identifying where the greatest interests or threats to national security lie, what sort of
‘alliances’ or ‘partnerships’ are most beneficial in this changing world, and what sort of global
governance structures these countries might aspire to be part of. At issue are relationships not just with
China, but with the United States and across a range of institutions of global governance.

The Benefits of Free Trade: A Guide For Policymakers




By Denise H. Froning
International trade is the framework upon which American prosperity rests. Free trade policies have created a level of competition in today's open market that engenders continual innovation and leads to better products, better-paying jobs, new markets, and increased savings and investment. Free trade enables more goods and services to reach American consumers at lower prices, thereby substantially increasing their standard of living.

Moreover, the benefits of free trade extend well beyond American households. Free trade helps to spread the value of freedom, reinforce the rule of law, and foster economic development in poor countries. The national debate over trade-related issues too often ignores these important benefits.

The positive effects of an open market are clearly evident in the stellar growth of the U.S. economy over the past decade. Since 1990, the U.S. economy has grown by more than 23 percent, adding more than USD2.1 trillion to the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) and raising the wealth of the average American consumer by more than USD5,500.2 The economy responded well to the expansion of trade that occurred after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993 and the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 as a forum for settling trade disputes. For example:

--Since 1990, imports of real goods and services have increased 115 percent.


--The number of full-time jobs has increased by 13.4 percent since 1991. The share of the labor force that works part-time because of an inability to find a full-time job is less than 3 percent.


--As of July 2000, the unemployment rate had hovered within one-tenth of a point from 4 percent for almost a year--the lowest rate in 30 years.3 


--The stellar record of growth has continued in the United States at the end of the decade as well: Between 1998 and 1999 alone, total employment increased by 2 million.4 


To be sure, many more policymakers today acknowledge the benefits of free trade than when Congress passed the Tariff Act of 1930 (the Smoot-Hawley Act). The devastation wrought by these protectionist tariffs led successive U.S. administrations to support free trade after World War II. Their grand vision of a world comprised of nations at peace who traded freely among themselves for the prosperity of all has animated U.S. foreign policy and invigorated efforts to facilitate the opening of markets in every region.

A growing number of countries continue to share the benefits of America's emphasis on trade. As noted in a recent report by the International Financial Institution Advisory Commission chaired by Allan H. Meltzer, a former member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and Professor of Political Economy at Carnegie Mellon University:

The Congress, successive administrations, and the American public can be proud of these achievements. The United States has been the leader in maintaining peace and stability, promoting democracy and the rule of law, reducing trade barriers, and establishing a transnational financial system. Americans and their allies have willingly provided the manpower and money to make many of these achievements possible. The benefits have been widely shared by the citizens of developed and developing countries.

The dynamic American economy benefited along with the rest of the world. Growth of trade spread benefits widely. Per capita consumption in the United States tripled. As in other countries, higher educational attainment, improved health services, increased longevity, effective environmental programs, and other social benefits accompanied or followed economic gains.5

Despite these achievements, the United States, with one of the world's most open markets, continues to apply barriers to trade--most notably tariffs and quotas in the apparel and textile industry and in agriculture--that increase the cost of goods for consumers and harm people in developing countries who rely on this trade for their meager incomes. In this respect, the trade and Development Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-200) enacted on May 18, 2000, by lowering some of these barriers to trade, is a step in the right direction.

Congress and the President should take every opportunity to articulate the benefits of trade to the American people and to expand international trade by any possible means, such as the unilateral lowering of trade barriers, the forging of regional and bilateral trade agreements, and working within international trade forums like the WTO. Ultimately, the straightforward and tangible benefits that derive from each of these steps will help both hardworking American families and impoverished people around the world.


BENEFITS OF FREE trade

The benefits of free trade are many and far outweigh any risks that foreign competition might pose to the U.S. economy. These benefits fall into four major categories.


Benefit #1: Free trade promotes innovation and competition.

Few people in America today sew all their own clothes, grow all their own food, build their own houses, or buy only products made in their own states. It would cost too much and take too much time, especially since Americans can acquire such items on the open market with relative ease. The same principle of practicality and cost applies on an international scale. It makes economic sense to buy a product from another who specializes in such production or who can make it more easily or for less cost.

Indeed, access to a greater variety of goods and services is the purpose of trade. Imports, then, are not a sacrifice, a necessary evil for the good of exporting. One exports so that one may acquire goods and services in return. This logic is evident on a personal level as well: A person works so that he has the means to buy necessities and possibly even luxuries. One does not make purchases in order to justify working.

Free trade is the only type of truly fair trade because it offers consumers the most choices and the best opportunities to improve their standard of living. It fosters competition, spurring companies to innovate and develop better products and to bring more of their goods and services to market, keeping prices low and quality high in order to retain or increase their market share.

Free trade also spurs innovation. The U.S. market has demonstrated repeatedly, particularly over the last decade, that competition leads to increasing innovation. This is evident, for example, in the intense competition to create the latest personal computer at the lowest cost. With the growth of electronic commerce has come unlimited choices of goods and services and lower prices for products. Computers are now available for free just for signing an annual Internet provider service agreement.6

In fact, America's greatest advantage lies in its ability to innovate and to build upon that continually expanding knowledge base. According to The Economist , the United States "has an `innovational complex'--those thousands of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and engineers--unmatched anywhere in the world."7 This resource results in an ever-growing number of new products and services that bolster America's competitive advantage in the global market and greater prosperity at home.

This competitive advantage derives largely from America's open market practices. Free trade promotes innovation because, along with goods and services, the flow of trade circulates new ideas. Since companies must compete with their overseas counterparts, American firms can take note of all the successes as well as the failures that take place in the global marketplace. Consumers then benefit because companies in a freely competing market must either keep up with the leader in order to retain customers or innovate to create their own niche.

In contrast, protectionist policies designed to restrict foreign competition exact a heavy cost on consumers. This is perhaps best demonstrated by the European Union (EU), which protects, for example, its members' agriculture industries from foreign competition through such policies as restricting imports of beef and maintaining a protectionist regime on bananas.

In June 1999, testifying before the Senate Committee on agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry on the need to reform the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky observed that

The European CAP, including USD60 billion in trade-distorting subsidies, and 85 percent of the world's agricultural export subsidies, is among the largest distortions of world trade in any sector. Reform is in everybody's interest. The combination of high tariffs and subsidies make European consumers pay prices far above world markets for food. Export subsidies, in particular, place an immense and unfair burden on farmers in other countries, especially developing countries.8

The end result of these policies has been to deprive consumers across Europe of access to more goods at fairer prices.

Though Ambassador Barshefsky's statement demonstrates that the Clinton Administration has recognized the negative impact of protectionist policies, protectionism continues to thrive in America's own agriculture sector, perpetuated by federal subsidies on products such as peanuts and sugar.

The common misperception that American farmers need subsidies to survive belies the evidence that American farmers themselves have amassed--evidence that is a tribute to their efficiency and hard work. By using the innate talent to innovate that Americans have developed so well, farmers have vastly increased productivity over the years. In fact, between 1948 and 1996, U.S. agricultural labor productivity increased more than eightfold, and agricultural production doubled, even as total input use (including labor, land, and machinery) declined.9

Clearly, removing counterproductive barriers to competition, such as quotas and tariffs that limit access and competition, is both good economic policy and good public policy.


Benefit #2: Free trade generates economic growth.

By fostering opportunities for American businesses, free trade rewards risk-taking by increasing sales, profit margins, and market share. Companies can choose to build on those profits by expanding their operations, entering new market sectors, and creating better-paying jobs. According to U.S. Trade Representative Barshefsky, U.S. exports support over 12 million jobs in America, and trade-related jobs pay an average of 13 percent to 16 percent higher wages than do non-trade-related jobs.10

Opponents of free trade fear that efforts to remove protectionist barriers to foreign competition will result in the loss of blue-collar jobs in America, especially in the manufacturing sector. They believe that the North American Free Trade Agreement in particular threatens these jobs. Yet, as Chart 1 (page 5) shows, the facts belie this fear.

The nature of employment in the United States is indeed evolving away from manufacturing and toward more service-oriented and high-technology jobs. However, the record shows that trading freely with America's NAFTA partners, Canada and Mexico, has not resulted in an aggregate loss of manufacturing jobs. Instead, since 1994:

--14 million new American jobs have been reported;


--The unemployment rate in America has fallen from 6 percent to 3.9 percent (as of April 2000); and


--The number of manufacturing jobs in America has remained steady, employing 18.3 million people in 1994 and 18.4 million in 1999, which represents 14 percent of the total American workforce.11 


On balance, not only has NAFTA not resulted in a loss of factory jobs in the United States, but it has not led to a loss in real wages for manufacturing workers. The average real wage in the manufacturing sector rose from USD8.03 per hour in 1994 to USD8.26 per hour in 1999 (in constant inflation-adjusted dollars).12

Moreover, saving just one job in America's declining apparel and textile industry is estimated to cost the taxpayers more than USD100,000 each year.13 The workforce in this sector, which has declined by approximately 30 percent since 1989, comprises just 1 percent of total non-farm employment. The decline is a natural outcome, considering that the industry pays far less than the average national wage--nearly 20 percent less in textiles and 33 percent less in apparel.14 Such lower-paying jobs become marginal as workers move to better-paying jobs in the broader market. In fact, over the past decade, 19 million more jobs have become available,15 demonstrating that there are many opportunities for American workers to find jobs.


















Since NAFTA took effect, total U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico has risen more than 86 percent--from USD299 billion in 1993 to more than USD550 billion in 1999. U.S. exports surpassed USD2,350 billion in 1999, making up slightly more than 25 percent of overall GDP and more than 15 percent of all global trade.16

The growth in the U.S. economy also benefits people in poor countries who have access to the U.S. market, where both the demand for goods and services and levels of remuneration are much higher than they would be at home. To trade at this level enables their nascent businesses to acquire capital, fueling production and fostering the development of new industries. Impoverished people gain the opportunity to earn better wages, acquire more goods, and raise their standard of living.

In other words, this is a win-win scenario for Americans and people of countries that have been mired in poverty despite years of foreign aid.17 The advantage for poor countries in being able to trade for capital--rather than having to rely on ineffective assistance programs that are subject to waste or fraud--is that the payoff is more immediate in their private sectors. Foreign investment allows their domestic industries to develop and provide better employment opportunities for local workers. This dynamic makes an increase in foreign direct investment one of the most important benefits of free trade for developing nations.18


Benefit #3: Free trade disseminates democratic values.

Free trade fosters support for the rule of law. Companies that engage in international trade have reason to abide by the terms of their contracts and international agreed-upon norms and laws. The World Trade Organization, for example, compels its member countries to honor trade agreements and, in any trade dispute, to abide by the decisions of the WTO's mediating body.

By supporting the rule of law, free trade also can reduce the opportunities for corruption. In countries where contracts are not enforced, business relationships fail, foreign investors flee, and capital stays away. It is a downward spiral that especially hinders economic development in countries where official corruption is widespread. As Alejandro Chafuen, President of the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, has noted, "True economic freedom is possible only under a system of limited government with a strong rule of law. Economic freedom has little value if corruption in government means that only a few will enjoy it."19

trade likewise can falter quickly in countries where customs officials expect kickbacks at every checkpoint. In Western Africa, customs officials can stop trucks carrying goods as often as every hundred yards just to collect another bribe, as Mabousso Thiam, executive secretary of the West African Enterprise Network, testified at a 1999 Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) conference on corruption.20 Such arbitrary checkpoints spring up when countries cannot pay their customs officials livable wages, forcing them to choose between remaining honest but failing to bring home enough money to feed their families or taking an illegal bribe, as others often do. As U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has observed,

Corruption is built on everything being in the hands of the government. So for everything you want, you need a permit. The person who gives you the permit wants a bribe. The person who's going to make the appointment for you wants a bribe. And so on.21

Free trade, reinforced by the rule of law, removes such incentives for corruption by spurring economic growth, increasing the number of better-paying jobs, and ultimately increasing the level of prosperity.

But free trade transmits more than just physical goods or services to people. It also transmits ideas and values. A culture of freedom can flourish whenever a great society, as 18th century economist Adam Smith termed it, emerges with the self-confidence to open itself to an inflow of goods and the ideas and practices accompanying them. A culture of freedom can become both the cornerstone and capstone of economic prosperity.


Benefit #4: Free trade fosters economic freedom.

As the foregoing discussion shows, the ability to trade freely increases opportunity, choices, and standards of living. Countries with the freest economies today22 generally have adopted a capitalist model of economic development, remaining open to international trade and investment. These countries include the United Kingdom and many of its former colonies and dominions: Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, the United States, Australia, and Canada.

Chile, which benefits from a diverse European heritage, likewise demonstrates that basing economic policies on a capitalist free-market model brings good results in that region as well.

Heritage's analysis of the 161 countries covered in the Index of Economic Freedom , published annually with The Wall Street Journal , indicates that free trade policies can foster development and raise the level of economic freedom. Every day in the marketplaces of free countries, individuals make choices and exercise direct control over their own lives. As economic growth occurs, note World Bank economists David Dollar and Aart Kraay, the poorest people can benefit just as much as--and in some cases more than--the wealthy.23 With a sound infrastructure based on economic freedom, assured property rights, a fair and independent judiciary, the free flow of capital, and a fair system of low taxation, poor countries can create an environment that is friendly to trade and inviting to foreign investors.


 Consider the experience of China and Taiwan. In 1960, real per capita income in the People's Republic of China tracked closely with that of the Republic of China on Taiwan. In the late 1960s, however, the government in Taipei chose to institute widespread reforms to guarantee private property, establish a legal system to protect property rights and enforce contracts, reform the banking and financial systems, stabilize taxes, distribute public land to individuals, and allow the market to flourish. The result for Taiwan has been an astounding record of economic growth. (See Chart 2.)

The 2000 Index of Economic Freedom ranks Taiwan as the 11th freest economy in the world. With its economic freedom came the rise of democratic institutions. For the first time since the ruling party (the Kuomintang, or KMT) established a government in Taipei 50 years ago, a democratic transition of power took place in Taiwan as Chen Shui-bian, a candidate from a previously outlawed opposition party, assumed the presidency on May 20, 2000.

Despite this success, opponents of permanent normal trade relations with China argue that trade and economic liberalization will not bring democracy to mainland China or improve its human rights record. These critics assert that democracy is simply too foreign to the mainland--an argument that ironically echoes the mutterings of Asian authoritarian regimes about "Asian values." The development of political and economic freedom in Taiwan refutes such claims and points to the potential that more political and economic freedom can develop in China. Such an outcome would be in America's best interest> because it would enhance regional stability, increase prosperity for the Chinese, and open China's immense market to Americans.

The U.S. trade agreement with China signed by the Clinton Administration in November 1999 is a step in the right direction. It will help open the Chinese market to American exports and foreign direct investment to an unprecedented degree. Economic freedom is the biggest benefit of trade extension, both for American companies looking to invest in China and for the Chinese people themselves. These foundations of economic freedom not only will allow the Chinese people to gain access to the outside world, but also will expose the Chinese government to--and compel it to enforce--the international consensus on the rule of law. Such issues as property rights and honoring contracts, which companies historically have found to be a problem when trying to make deals in China, will be subject to a higher force.

Establishing the backbone of property rights and free-market policies is essential for creating the sort of market stability that is important to foreign investors. In countries with an established rule of law that does not ebb and flow from one leader to the next, foreign investors are more confident and willing to take risks in bringing businesses into developing nations. It is one reason Taiwan and Hong Kong, for example, have flourished over the past few decades.24

Taiwan's success demonstrates that if China opens its market, economic and political freedom will have a real chance to develop. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, by approving permanent normal trading relations (PNTR) with China on May 24, 2000, demonstrated their confidence in economic freedom by voting to lend U.S. assistance to this endeavor through freer economic exchange. Members of the U.S. Senate will have the same opportunity to endorse economic freedom when they vote on the matter in September.

It is reasonable to wonder how the concept of economic freedom, the fruits of which are so easily identified in wealthier countries, can apply to desperately poor countries that are concerned primarily with food supplies and access to running water and electricity. How does one draw conclusions from an apples-to-oranges comparison of prosperous high-technology countries, where children surf daily on the Internet using the family computer, and low-income nations like Burkina Faso where most children live in families that scrape by on little more than subsistence-level farming.

Indian economist Barun Mitra explains it succinctly: "Traders in the marketplace are like voters in a democracy. If [the] free flow of ideas is essential to sustain political freedom and a democratic polity, then free trade is critical to sustain economic freedom and an efficient marketplace. Liberty, after all, is indivisible."25 Countries that suffer under overregulation, corruption, and the lack of the rule of law benefit by removing barriers to trade and allowing their citizens to participate directly in the global marketplace.

Often, countries in Asia and the West can be widely disparate in the cultural and political realms, with economic repression and economic freedom existing in both regions. Nonetheless, a basic structure upon which to build economic freedom can be found in countries as different as Bahrain (an Arab monarchy), Singapore (an authoritarian city-state), the United States (a constitutional democracy), and Switzerland (a federal system of cantons encompassing at least four different cultures).

As a whole, sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree and poorest area in the world; but as the Index analysis shows, its poverty is not the result of insufficient levels of foreign aid: On a per capita basis, many sub-Saharan African countries receive the world's highest levels of economic assistance.26 Rather, the main causes of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa are the lack of economic freedom embodied in self-imposed policies, and systemic and rampant corruption.

In fact, corruption is a cancer on the most legitimate efforts to promote economic development in many of these countries. While this is hardly a problem unique to Africa or developing nations, it is all the more damaging to them. The outlook for this region is not hopeless, however: Mauritius, which received the highest Index ranking in the region, has had some success in adopting free-market practices. Compared with other countries in its region, it merits relatively favorable scores in black market activity and regulation.

The Index findings for sub-Saharan Africa cast doubt on the assertion that huge transfers of wealth from industrialized nations to the less developed world will result in economic growth. The people of Zimbabwe and Congo, to name just two examples, are not poor because people in the West do not share enough of their wealth with them. They are poor because their governments pursue destructive economic policies that depress free enterprise or allow corrupt practices to derail the rule of law. Only when their ruling regimes increase economic freedom and unleash the power of the free market can these people embark on the road to prosperity. Anything short of free trade policies will continue to be both economically unwise and inhumane.

The United States can promote economic freedom in these countries through more effective means than economic assistance. As noted above, the United States imposes tariffs that add to the cost of selling products in the U.S. and makes imported goods less competitive with domestic products. Although America's average tariff rate of 2 percent is low by global standards,27 the United States does not apply its tariff rate evenly on products that it purchases from its trading partners. Instead, it applies the tariffs according to the types of goods that reach America's shores.

Regrettably, the goods that face the highest U.S. tariffs are precisely those produced by the poorest countries, such as agricultural goods, textiles, and apparel. The high level of tariffs combined with the impact of quotas is prohibitive for countries struggling to create a presence in the global marketplace and lift their people out of decades of poverty.

This disparity in tariff rates exists primarily because poor countries tend to export more of the types of commodities that are subject to high U.S. tariffs. Low-income countries develop industries that meet the basic needs of their people and for which they have a comparative advantage. The textile and apparel industries and agriculture are key economic activities because they satisfy domestic needs and do not require sophisticated machinery or large amounts of capital to turn a profit. What they do require--and what these nations have--is a large labor force.

Consider Nepal and Bangladesh, in which textile and apparel products make up 85 percent and 77 percent of total exports, respectively.28These countries, with per capita GDPs of less than USD300 each, face significant obstacles in trying to sell their products in the U.S. market. The average U.S. tariff rates on their products are 13.2 percent and 13.6 percent, respectively--more than six times the U.S. average.

The impact of these tariffs depends on their size and the responsiveness of U.S. consumers to the price changes on the products. In the case of some textile and apparel29 and agricultural imports, consumers are highly sensitive to price changes and will buy a domestic product rather than an imported one should the latter become too expensive. For example, for every 1 percent increase in the tariff rate for imported knitted fabrics, consumption of domestic knitted fabrics increases by over 2.9 percent.30 Thus, even a small increase in the tariff rate will discourage the purchase, and ultimately the production, of these imports, restricting primarily the access of developing countries to America's large market.

Ironically, any benefits that the tariffs may produce for the U.S. economy are miniscule compared with the total cost Americans pay for this protection. Economists at the Institute for International Economics estimate that consumers would save USD70 billion if the United States eliminated all tariffs and quantitative restrictions on imports--or about USD750 per American household.31 Approximately 35 percent of these gains--or USD24.4 billion--would accrue from liberalizing the apparel and textile sector. This is the purpose of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, which requires that all quotas on textile imports must be eliminated by 2005.

In the end, tariffs the United States applies to protect a sector that is naturally in decline will impose a significant cost on American consumers and the people of the low-income countries who make the products and lack other job opportunities. When a factory shuts down in Bangladesh or Nepal (in part because of the impact of prohibitive U.S. tariffs on its products), the unemployed have no safety net and few alternatives.

By comparison, the United States offers displaced workers numerous opportunities to find new jobs. The trade Adjustment Assistance program, for example, helps people who lose their manufacturing jobs as a result of foreign imports to apply for welfare benefits and receive job training and job search and relocation assistance. The unemployed in America are able to find a new job in a median of 6.4 weeks.32

Reducing America's tariffs, promoting bilateral and regional free trade agreements, and working within the World Trade Organization to promote economic freedom through international trade is the best way to help Americans and the peoples of the developing world. The September 2000 vote in the U.S. Senate on granting China permanent normal trade relations will be both a key test of America's commitment to free trade and a crucial opportunity to improve economic freedom and choice for people in both the United States and China.


Conclusion

Societies that enact free trade policies create their own economic dynamism--fostering a wellspring of freedom, opportunity, and prosperity that benefits every citizen. In recent years, the United States has demonstrated the power of this principle. Nor are American citizens alone in benefiting from those free trade policies that the U.S. enacts. By breaking the cycle of poverty, America's free trade policies can enable even the most impoverished countries to begin to create their own dynamic toward prosperity.

Nevertheless, despite all the evidence to the contrary, the opponents of free trade will continue to espouse the old argument that "the jobs created by globalization are often less sustaining and secure than the livelihoods abolished by it [in poor countries]."33 Such a claim presupposes that some sort of agrarian utopia previously existed in these countries and that their peoples will not reap the benefits of economic development.

Clamoring to stop this wave of economic progress carried forward by technology and innovation is akin to arguing that the United States, to cite just one example, was better off before the Industrial Revolution. While one might argue that this was true of the white male members of the landed classes (although even then such a claim is dubious), for the majority of the population that did not enjoy such luxury, quality of life has improved immeasurably.

The Industrial Revolution brought freedom of movement and increased opportunity to all economic levels of society. It also set the stage for social and democratic progress of a magnitude that would have been impossible earlier. And although history suggests that this new era of market globalization may well be accompanied by new problems for which the solutions once again will lie in the power of human ingenuity and innovation, it also presents an unprecedented level of opportunity for people to achieve economic freedom and greater prosperity.
